## Advent Calendars
I bought a candy advent calendar for my wife and a whiskey advent calendar for me. I hope to write reviews
for both every day, but I'll give the over under at April for when I actually write it lol =P.

In previous years we got Advent calendars for the animals. Funny thing - dog Advent calendars are almost always 
treats, cat advent calendars are almost always toys, and horse Advent calendarsâ€¦ okay those don't exist to my 
knowledge (or would be very expense). At the end of the day we were left with a bunch of cat toys that that the 
cats leave everywhere for the Roomba to eat 

This year we got the [Sugarfina Advent Calendar](https://amzn.to/3GsPj3B) as well as the 
[2023 Flaviar Whiskey Advent Calendar](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8792051122458&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fadvent-calendar-2023-offline&intsrc=PUI2_15277). I was content to leave the candy to Barb and the 
Whiskey to me, but Barb decided she wants to try whiskey, so now I have to share. At least the calendar came with 
two glasses!

<!--more-->

So anyway, hopefully soon there will be lots of links here to reviews of candy and whiskey, just because 
I want to do something with this site. 

## Day 1
### [Sagamore Spirit Rye](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530692374810&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fsagamore-spirit-straight-rye-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277) 
Sagamore isn't my favorite but I certainly don't hate it. 83 proof. It was too hot for Barb, but it seems like it was more the 
rye than the ethanol that she had a problem with 

### [Chocolate Covered Cookie Dough Bites](https://www.sugarfina.com/chocolate-covered-cookie-dough)
These were pretty nice, although I would have liked more! Exactly what you would expect - tiny little chocolate balls with 
a cookie dough center

## Day 2
### [J.J. Corry 'The Hanson'](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530539282714&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fjj-corry-the-hanson-batch-no-2-irish-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
Also not my favorite, but definitely something new! 92 proof and fairly tasty. I wouldn't say no if offered, but probably wouldn't buy 
it on my own.
### [Cookies and Cream](https://www.sugarfina.com/cookies-and-cream-taster)
Very yummy, tastes exactly what I expected them to taste like.

## Day 3
### [Uncle Nearest 1856](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530667077914&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Funcle-nearest-1856-premium-aged-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
I have a confession - I _hate_ Uncle Nearest. I really, really don't like it. I'm not a fan of those earthy flavors. Barb loved it =)
100 proof, tastes like dirt. Maybe that's your thing, if so Uncle Nearest might be perfect for you!

### [Merry Berries](https://www.sugarfina.com/ca/sugarfina-holiday-merry-berries-gummy-candy-cube)
These are **amazing** so of course they're sold out of them lol. Very similar to the raspberry candy you find in the candy store - hard outside and 
soft inside, except these are somehow better than what you usually get. Maybe they were just more fresh than what you usually get out of the 
big drum at the store.

## Day 4
### [Starward Solera Single Malt Australian Whisky](https://flaviar.com/products/starward-solera-single-malt-australian-whisky-750)
**Hoooooooollllyyyyy shiiit** this is good. Aged in Apera (which apparently is Australian for sherry) casks. Very reminiscent of 
a sherry aged Scotch. 86 proof, which is a little lower than I usually like it, but man is this tasty and goes down very easy. 
The taste is very sweet and rich with lots of dark fruit flavors. This is the first bottle from the Advent calendar that I am 100% buying a bottle.

### [Penguin Presents](https://www.sugarfina.com/sugarfina-penguin-presents-gummy-candy-cube)
Straight up gummies in the shape of an adorable penguin holding a present. The gummies have a delightful fruity 
pomegranate/apricot flavor that I honestly think went quite well with the Starward.


## Day 5
### [Black Button Pre-Prohibition Style Straight Bourbon Whiskey](https://flaviar.com/products/black-button-pre-prohibition-style-straight-bourbon-whiskey-750)
Pretty good, but not as nice as the Starward. I wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't seek it out either.
### [Raspberry Eiffel Towers](https://www.sugarfina.com/rasperberry-eiffel-towers-gummy)
These are just adorable and taste pretty good as well (let's be honest - kind of hard to fuck up gummies)

## Day 6
### [Filey Bay Flagship Single Malt Whisky](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530954289434&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Ffiley-bay-flagship-single-malt-whisky-700&intsrc=APIG_15277)
This one was quite nice. I didn't like it as much as the Starward, but overall a nice single malt. I definitely picked 
up on the orange peel (which is one of the flavors I like) and the sweeter fruits were very apparent.
### [Holiday Hearts](https://www.sugarfina.com/strawberry-hearts-candy-cube)
I'm not sure I linked the right ones here, but the ones we had smelled _delightful_ and tasted quite nice. 
They are the softer, squishier type of gummy that I really like.

## Day 7
### [Frey Ranch Bottled-in-bond Rye](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530829279514&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Ffrey-ranch-straight-rye-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
Note that I couldn't find a link for this exact bottle. This was pretty good, not my favorite rye but far from 
my least favorite (looking at you [Balcones](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530710954266&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fbalcones-texas-rye-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)). There were some caramel hints 
but overall very rye-ish, which Barb did not appreciate
### [Little Snowmen](https://www.shopambiance.com/products/sugarfina-small-snow-buddies-snowman-gummies)
These were adorable. 

## Day 8
### [Famous Grouse smoky Black](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8743882621210&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-famous-grouse-smoky-black-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
The first real smoky whisky. Feels like a smoky [Monkey shoulder](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530781634842&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fmonkey-shoulder-blended-scotch-whisky-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277), which is to say - pretty 
standard entry level. Definitely had the phenols going on, which was funny because it reminded me of whatever chemical 
they put in the [World Equestrian Center](https://worldequestriancenter.com/wilmington-oh/) to keep the sand nice. 
Yay chemicals! Now where was I? Oh yeah - standard smokey scotch. Not going to smack you in the face with it, but it's there. 
I thought it was okay, Barb was not a fan.
### [Sparkling Stars](https://www.sugarfina.com/sugarfina-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-gummies)
Standard gummies. Pretty tasty.

## Day 9
### [Stauning Rye](https://flaviar.com/products/stauning-rye-danish-whisky-750)
Another Rye! I smelled it, and didn't even bother pouring Barb some, because I knew she'd hate it. This was an interesting 
experience, but I'm not sure I loved it. It was quite fun to taste a Danish rye though, not sure sure that I've had 
any whiskey from Denmark before.
### [Petite Strawberries](https://www.sugarfina.com/summer-strawberries-small)
Pretty standard strawberry gummy candy

## Day 10
### [Breckenridge Port Cask Finish Whiskey](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530759221530&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fbreckenridge-port-cask-finish-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
We had a busy weekend and tried this one at the same time as the Stauning Rye, figured it was a safe bet for Barb. Nooooope! 
This was really intense, with lots of spicey rye notes. I thought it was okay, Barb hated it.
### [Riptide Raspberries](https://www.sugarfina.com/riptide-raspberries-gummy-sugarfina)
Almost exactly the same as the strawberries, but raspberry. Can't complain

## Day 11
### [Silkie The Legendary Dark Silkie](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530638766362&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fsilkie-dark-irish-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
I have never had a peated Irish whiskey and all I can say is hoooooly shit - buckle up butter cup cuz this is going to punch you 
right in the back of the tongue with smokey, peaty, char. It goes on and on and on and on. I could smell the smoke, but was not 
prepared for how much stronger it would be on the taste.  Barb took one sip and handed the rest to 
me. Imagine my surprise when her glass (with ice) _tasted even more smokey_. How the fuck does that work? I swear to you 
it tastes like brimstone and fire with water added. Somehow the peat flavor is more obnoxious than my bottle of 
[Octomore 12.1](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530547081498&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fbruichladdich-octomore-12-1-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277). Don't get me wrong - the Octomore is 100% more 
smokey, but somehow leaves more of a charred burning flavor in my mouth.

I do like some of those funky flavors in a peated whiskey, but this wasn't my favorite. I might pick up a bottle 
just to torture my friends with though. 
### [Sprinkle Donuts](https://www.sugarfina.com/ca/sprinkle-donuts-canada)
These looked really cute, but I didn't love the taste. It wasn't terrible, just not for me.

## Day 12
### [Sonoma Cherrywood Smoked Rye](https://flaviar.com/products/sonoma-cherrywood-smoked-rye-whiskey-700)
This was surprisingly good for a rye, lots of vanilla and fruity flavors with less of the [stereotypical rye](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530687852826&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Frossville-union-straight-rye-whiskey-750&intsrc=APIG_15277) flavors 
### [Birthday Cake Cookies](https://www.sugarfina.com/birthday-cake-cookies-small)
These were pretty tasty and a nice diversion from gummies. They are sugar cookie bites wrapped in white chocolate and 
they tasted about exactly how you would expect. 

## Day 13
### [Lochlea Our Barley Single Malt](https://flaviar.com/products/lochlea-our-barley-single-malt-scotch-whisky-700)
This was delightful. Very sweet and definitely could pick out the pear flavors. One of the reviews stated that 
"it doesn't have much to say" which I tend to agree with, this isn't going to grab you by the shoulders and shake you real hard. 
The flavors are more subtle than a lot of single malts. I liked this one and Barb _really_ liked this one.
### [Candy Cane Caramels](https://www.sugarfina.com/sugarfina-holiday-2023-candy-cane-chocolate-caramels)
I love caramel and these did not disappoint, they were _fantastic_! 

## Day 14
### [Yellowstone American Single Malt](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530934595866&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fyellowstone-american-single-malt-whiskey-750&intsrc=APIG_15277)
Another malt! Less pear than yesterday, but still there. More fruity and sweet. I didn't realize that 
[Yellowstone](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530611699994&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fyellowstone-select-kentucky-straight-bourbon-whiskey-750&intsrc=APIG_15277) was 
[MGP](https://www.mgpingredients.com/)'s in-house brand or I would have tried it earlier. Barb liked this one as well, so it's an all 
around winner.
### [Peach Bums](https://www.sugarfina.com/peach-bum-sugarfina-gummy)
No idea why these are called "bums" but these are fantastic! Apparently they are made with real peach puree and it 
shows in both the smell and taste. The texture isn't chewy at all, just the right resistance as you bight through. 
We really loved these, enough to want to get some more

## Day 15
### [Bushmills 12 Year Single Malt](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530850021658&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fbushmills-12-year-old-single-malt-irish-whiskey-750&intsrc=APIG_15277)
Another day, another single malt that Barb likes. I can't complain. This isn't the most complex but it was very smooth with lots of 
sweet flavors.
### [Peach Hearts](https://www.sugarfina.com/peach-bellini)
Sugarfina apparently loves them some peach. We definitely cannot complain because we love peach and these were pretty great yet 
again. Very peachy this time with a slightly harder chew to them than yesterday's Peach Bums

## Day 16
### [Ichiro Malt and Grain](https://flaviar.com/products/ichiros-malt-grain-whisky-750?_pos=1&_sid=193521318&_ss=r)
Japanese whiskey can be a [little sketchy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2021/09/11/understanding-japanese-whisky-why-it-isnt-always-what-it-seems/?sh=279b1f4b310f) 
a lot of it is quite nice and often is very similar in flavor to a Speyside malt and this isn't any different. Not nearly as 
malty as you would expect but very fruity and sweet. Of course you know what's coming - Barb liked this one (and I do too).
### [Island Pineapples](https://www.sugarfina.com/island-pineapples)
These were a very nice change of pace from all that peach! Lovely vegan pineapple gummies.

## Day 17
### [Copper Fox Rye](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530811060506&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fcopper-fox-rye-1-750&intsrc=APIG_15277)
Pretty standard rye. Not sure I would seek it out with all the fantastic ryes out there, but it was fun to try. Barb was indifferent because she has 
a head cold and couldn't taste anything.
### [Banana Gummies](https://www.sugarfina.com/cabana-banana-gummy-sugarfina)
These were adorable banana shaped gummies with a fantastic banana flavor.

## Day 18
### [Naked Malt](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8586352886042&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fnaked-malt-blended-malt-scotch-whisky-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
This was delightful surprise. The tasting notes list smoky but this is probably the smoothest "smoky" Scotch I've ever had. Even Barb liked this one. 
Not sure that I would go out of my way to get this, but if it was available locally it would be a great every day drinker at $40.
### [Apple Frogs](https://www.sugarfina.com/apple-frogs)
These were pretty adorable gummies with a great apple flavor in a cute little frog shape.

## Day 19
### [Journeyman Fetherbond Cask Strength Bourbon](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530956222746&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fjourneyman-featherbone-cask-strength-bourbon-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
I'll be the first to admit that my taste in whiskey is not totally rock solid. This is a pretty solid bourbon that does everything a bourbon should. 
Even Barb loved it!
### [Santa's Trees](https://www.sugarfina.com/ca/sugarfina-holiday-santas-trees-gummy-candy-cube)
Another day, another gummy. These are red (raspberry) and green (apple) flavored Christmas trees. They were good, but we're getting a little tired 
of gummies and wish there was more variety.

## Day 20
### [Minor Case Rye](https://flaviar.com/products/minor-case-rye-750)
This was a nice, solid rye. Even Barb liked it, which is somewhat unusual for a rye.
### [Rainbow Bears](https://www.sugarfina.com/rainbow-bears)
Another day, more gummies. The yellow ones were very intense. Not much else to say about them. Definitely burning out on gummies.

## Day 21
### [Limavady Single Barrel Irish](https://flaviar.com/products/limavady-single-malt-irish-whiskey-750?_pos=1&_sid=4d4819bc5&_ss=r)
Definitely not what I would think of as a typical Irish whiskey, which means I liked it. Nothing extraordinary but decent. 
Barb wasn't a fan, but we couldn't put our finger on what it was that she didn't like.
### [Baby Whales](https://www.sugarfina.com/baby-whales)
These were super cute but made me feel weird. Who would eat a baby whale? That's just horrible!
