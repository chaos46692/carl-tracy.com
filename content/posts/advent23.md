## Advent Calendars
I bought a candy advent calendar for my wife and a whiskey advent calendar for me. I hope to write reviews
for both every day, but I'll give the over under at April for when I actually write it lol =P.

In previous years we got Advent calendars for the animals. Funny thing - dog Advent calendars are almost always 
treats, cat advent calendars are almost always toys, and horse Advent calendarsâ€¦ okay those don't exist to my 
knowledge (or would be very expense). At the end of the day we were left with a bunch of cat toys that that the 
cats leave everywhere for the Roomba to eat 

This year we got the [Sugarfina Advent Calendar](https://amzn.to/3GsPj3B) as well as the 
[2023 Flaviar Whiskey Advent Calendar](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8792051122458&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fadvent-calendar-2023-offline&intsrc=PUI2_15277). I was content to leave the candy to Barb and the 
Whiskey to me, but Barb decided she wants to try whiskey, so now I have to share. At least the calendar came with 
two glasses!

<!--more-->

So anyway, hopefully soon there will be lots of links here to reviews of candy and whiskey, just because 
I want to do something with this site. 

## Day 1
### [Sagamore Spirit Rye](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530692374810&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fsagamore-spirit-straight-rye-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277) 
Sagamore isn't my favorite but I certainly don't hate it. 83 proof. It was too hot for Barb, but it seems like it was more the 
rye than the ethanol that she had a problem with 

### [Chocolate Covered Cookie Dough Bites](https://www.sugarfina.com/chocolate-covered-cookie-dough)
These were pretty nice, although I would have liked more! Exactly what you would expect - tiny little chocolate balls with 
a cookie dough center

## Day 2
### [J.J. Corry 'The Hanson'](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530539282714&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Fjj-corry-the-hanson-batch-no-2-irish-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
Also not my favorite, but definitely something new! 92 proof and fairly tasty. I wouldn't say no if offered, but probably wouldn't buy 
it on my own.
### [Cookies and Cream](https://www.sugarfina.com/cookies-and-cream-taster)
Very yummy, tastes exactly what I expected them to taste like.

## Day 3
### [Uncle Nearest 1856](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530667077914&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Funcle-nearest-1856-premium-aged-whiskey-750&intsrc=PUI2_15277)
I have a confession - I _hate_ Uncle Nearest. I really, really don't like it. I'm not a fan of those earthy flavors. Barb loved it =)
100 proof, tastes like dirt. Maybe that's your thing, if so Uncle Nearest might be perfect for you!

### [Merry Berries](https://www.sugarfina.com/ca/sugarfina-holiday-merry-berries-gummy-candy-cube)
These are **amazing** so of course they're sold out of them lol. Very similar to the raspberry candy you find in the candy store - hard outside and 
soft inside, except these are somehow better than what you usually get. Maybe they were just more fresh than what you usually get out of the 
big drum at the store.

## Day 4
### [Starward Solera Single Malt Australian Whisky](https://flaviar.com/products/starward-solera-single-malt-australian-whisky-750)
**Hoooooooollllyyyyy shiiit** this is good. Aged in Apera (which apparently is Australian for sherry) casks. Very reminiscent of 
a sherry aged Scotch. 86 proof, which is a little lower than I usually like it, but man is this tasty and goes down very easy. 
The taste is very sweet and rich with lots of dark fruit flavors. This is the first bottle from the Advent calendar that I am 100% buying a bottle.

### [Penguin Presents](https://www.sugarfina.com/sugarfina-penguin-presents-gummy-candy-cube)
Straight up gummies in the shape of an adorable penguin holding a present. The gummies have a delightful fruity 
pomegranate/apricot flavor that I honestly think went quite well with the Starward.


## Day 5
### [Black Button Pre-Prohibition Style Straight Bourbon Whiskey](https://flaviar.com/products/black-button-pre-prohibition-style-straight-bourbon-whiskey-750)
Pretty good, but not as nice as the Starward. I wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't seek it out either.
### [Raspberry Eiffel Towers](https://www.sugarfina.com/rasperberry-eiffel-towers-gummy)
These are just adorable and taste pretty good as well (let's be honest - kind of hard to fuck up gummies)

## Day 6
### [Filey Bay Flagship Single Malt Whisky](https://flaviar.5d3x.net/c/5043138/1891753/3334?prodsku=8530954289434&u=https%3A%2F%2Fflaviar.com%2Fproducts%2Ffiley-bay-flagship-single-malt-whisky-700&intsrc=APIG_15277)
This one was quite nice. I didn't like it as much as the Starward, but overall a nice single malt. I definitely picked 
up on the orange peel (which is one of the flavors I like) and the sweeter fruits were very apparent.
### [Holiday Hearts](https://www.sugarfina.com/strawberry-hearts-candy-cube)
I'm not sure I linked the right ones here, but the ones we had smelled _delightful_ and tasted quite nice. 
They are the softer, squishier type of gummy that I really like.
