Well it's the end of the year so it's that time that I tell you to go check out my media wrap up for the year!  Inspired by my friend  [Jen](https://jenmyers.net) I started
a media log, or at least keeping some kind of track of all the books I read, Jen catalogs all her media and I am not nearly that organized or ambitious. _However_, I did 
add a new entry this year for [Unconventional Christmas Movies]({{<ref Unconventional-christmas>}}) where I ramble on about Christmas horror movies in addition 
to my [annual book writeup]({{<ref books-23>}})  (that usually gets procrastinated until the end of the year lol)

You can check out the entirety of my media log [here](/media/)
