## Hello World!
It's been a while since I did anything with this site. I finally got around to building something with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I kind of dig the idea of a static site generator but I generally run Windows machines so it was kind of a pain in the ass. I finally got around to installing [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) on a virtual machine so now it was much easier to check out.

So let's give this a whirl and see if it works!
