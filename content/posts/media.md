![Stack of Books](/images/books.webp)

In 2022 I started listening to audio books on Audible and I read a _lot_ of books. Inspired by my friend  [Jen](https://jenmyers.net) I started
a media log. Jen catalogs all her media and I am not nearly that ambitious and I actually wanted to start writing short reviews and that really 
doesn't work with my work load/ADHD. So for the most part my media log is more like a running list of very short summaries of books I've read. 
I am certain that nobody really gives a shit but I'm not doing this for them anyway =)
