## New beginnings
My group at work recently got moved to a different department. I don't necessarily view it is a bad thing, but it certainly wasn't expected. 
Being moved from Investments into Risk Management almost certainly makes sense given the type of work that we do, I get to keep my manager 
who is amazing and his new boss is somebody I haven't worked with before, but I knew socially when he worked on our floor and is a pretty 
good guy. One of the nice things about the Risk group is they do a lot more social things, which I appreciate because while I'm not 
_against_ social gatherings, I generally won't think to organize them on my own. So far the events seem to be well thought out and just the 
right amount of fun while also being appropriate for the workplace.

## Christmastime Is Here
I'm usually pretty meh on the holidays. Having moved away from home for college/grad school and spending a lot of time fairly far away from 
family means that the Holidays generally translate to stress rather than joy. Driving from Illinois to Youngstown kind of sucked and driving 
from Connecticut to Youngstown sucked harder and driving from Connecticut to Illinois sucked the most of all. We spend most of our time 
trying to recover from the drive only to turn around and do it again. On top of that a lifetime of undiagnosed ADHD and the anxiety that 
came with it meant that the holidays were more _oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit_ and less happy happy joy to the world.

## Reality Christmas
Our very most favorite band [Over the Rhine](https://overtherhine.com/). OtR at it's core is a married duo who have never shied away from the [more uncomfortable parts of life](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/lookingcloser/2005/04/over-the-rhine-drunkards-prayer-the-looking-closer-review/). They have several albums of Christmas music, but while the first on is for the most part traditional [with a few hints of what was to come ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QypaZSJdmks&list=OLAK5uy_kwX7VSs0_nVs8qaIt4gmSBh7GBkW2P0b4&index=8) the later albums adhere more to a aesthetic that Karin and Lindford describe as "reality Christmas". They are, in my opinion, some of the best albums for folks who's feelings on Christmas are less sugar plumb feelgood nostalgia and a more melancholy (with perhaps a bit of seasonal affective disorder).

OtR are the only Christmas music I'll listen to, other than the obligatory listen of [Last Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8gmARGvPlI) 
[on Christmas morning in observance of Whamageddon](https://www.whamageddon.com/#rules). We rarely fail to catch them when they do their 
Christmas tour and their upcoming show in Columbus has me very much looking forward to our tradition of celebrating reality Christmas.  

In that spirit, here are some of my favorite Christmas songs from OtR:

### If We Make It Through December
Originally a Merle Haggard song, OtR put their own twist on it, not listening to the original before recording. As Linford recounted for 
[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-over-the-rhines-cover-of-classic-merle-haggard-christmas-song-179196/):
> We wanted just a distant memory of the tune — the ghost of the song — haunting a version that would hopefully be very much our own

### Let it Fall
Inspired by a note from a friend, this one never fails to get me teary eyed, especially post 2020
> Have you been trying too hard {{< line_break >}}
> Have you been holding too tight {{< line_break >}}
> Have you been worrying too much lately {{< line_break >}}
> All night {{< line_break >}}
> Whatever we've lost I think we're gonna let it go {{< line_break >}}
> Let it fall {{< line_break >}}
> Like snow {{< line_break >}}
> 'Cause rain and leaves {{< line_break >}}
> And snow and tears and stars {{< line_break >}}
> And that's not all my friend {{< line_break >}}
> They all fall with confidence and grace {{< line_break >}}
> So let it fall, let it fall{{< line_break >}}

### First Snowfall
Another one that hits hard and almost always have me teary eyed. Magnet Magazine [says](https://magnetmagazine.com/2022/04/11/live-review-over-the-rhine-philadelphia-pa-dec-1-2021/) it "cut(s) to the heart of what it means to hold out hope when you’re almost too cold to feel it flicker."
Ahhh, reality Christmas bedrock &lt;3

### Oh wait, there's more
I hope you've enjoyed my short list of depressing assed songs. If you dig their sound you can [buy their music on Port Merchandise](https://stores.portmerch.com/overtherhine/music.html) to support a local indy band. Hopefully soon I will post my list of favorite Christmas movies. Unless you're a bit weird like me I can guarantee there will be a few you haven't seen in the list =)
