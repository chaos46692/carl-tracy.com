#Back at it again
Well I certainly haven't done much wiht this lately. Part of that is I just feel like I didn't have much to say and part of it is the setup I had was a little too much of 
a pain to deploy. Because, you know, actually having to log in and push 2 or 3 buttons is **so** much of a pain. Anyway, I got a bug up my butt and figured out how to build 
things with AWS and GitHub and did a small project over at 	[Evil Peep](https://www.evilpeep.com) which has been sitting dormant for around 12 years. I figured while I was 
at it I might was well implement it for my site and use the opportunity to move from my old domain to this one! While I'm at it I figured I'd document what I did to make it 
all work.
##Amazon Web Services
I like AWS for a couple of reasons: it's fast, you're only charged for what you use it's an industry standard, and lots of people have done this stuff before me so I don't have to figure it out myself.
