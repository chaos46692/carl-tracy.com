Hi I'm Carl and I'm a giant dork. I live on a farm in Ohio and work for an insurance company.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this website just yet, but I'm sure I'll figure out something. I'll probably use this space to document the process of building a website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Ananke theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke). 

I'll try to add in some of the other stuff from my various iterations of my website like some of my favorite recipes and maybe some 
[math stuff]( {{< ref "posts/henon.md" >}} ). One of the really cool things about Markdown/Hugo is that you can build math directly into a website, check it out: 


$$ \rho {D \mathbf{u} \over Dt} = -\nabla p + \nabla  \cdot \boldsymbol{\tau} + \rho \mathbf{g} $$

Yay math!

I've also started to add [media reviews](/media/) as well as [reviews of our candy & whiskey Advent calendars]({{<ref advent23>}}).
