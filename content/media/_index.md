Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. Audble continues to be fantastic and I'm burning through 20+ 
books a year. Fair warning if you don't know me -  but if you're the kind of person who uses "woke" or "social justice warrior" in an un-ironic or 
derogatory manner then you're probably not going to like pretty much anything I'm reading.

# 2024 Media List

In usual fashion I slapped the [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}}) together last minute just in time for 2024. I'll try to do better this year
(lol). In other news **WHEN THE FUCK DID IT BECOME 2024**. This is not okay.

## Brute Force
### _Scott Meyer_
This was a pretty entertaining stand alone book by [Scott Meyer](https://scottmeyer.rocks/) and the first one outside the [Magic 2.0](https://amzn.to/48ZNCH9)[^magic20] 
universe.  A peaceful alliance of aliens has a problem - they've been overtaken by a violent species and need help from humans. Humans aren't doing so well, as they've 
managed to bomb themselves into near oblivion (which they refer to as "the bad week"), but they are the most violent species that they know, so they figure we can help them 
fix their civilization. Our hero Cross Agarwal leads a band of post-apocalyptic raiders who less than a week ago were trying to kill each other to save the aliens from this 
other species. In standard Scott Meyer form we get some great characters such as the cannibal _Meat Machine_ and _The Pile_ - sentient, quantum entangled sand that is aware 
of everything that happens anywhere one of it's piles happens to be. I liked this book quite a bit and am very much looking forward to Meyer's new books.

## Camp Damascus
### _Chuck Tingle_
I loved my first Chuck Tingle book and this one again did not disappoint. Rose is a very devout girl living in Neverton, Montana - a God-fearing community with the 
best gay conversion camp in the world (100% success rate!). Not everything is as it seems, and we follow Rose as she begins to question the motivations of her family 
and church before discovering the horrific truth about it all. There were some sections where I feel like the book dragged, but given this is Chuck's first 
book he sure as shit did better than I could have. I'm very much looking forward to his [next book](https://amzn.to/3vJk0j2).

## A Desolation Call Peace
### _Arkady Martine_
Once again we join Mahit Dzmare and Three Seagrass as they attempt to communicate with strange alines that seem bend on destroying everything they come across. If they 
succeed they could save the Teixcalaan Empire from destruction and allow it's continued expansion. If they fail it could mean an endless war. The story jumps between 
Mahit and Three Seagrass, Yaotlek Nine Hibiscus - a fleet captain who has been charged with preventing this newly discovered species from interrupting the empire 
and her right hand Twenty Cicada, and Eight Antidote - the soon-to-be Emperor who is learning about how the empire functions and who he will eventually become as 
Emperor of Teixcalaan.

I liked this book quite a bit. I'm a bit sad that this will be the last of the duology, but I'm looking forward to more Teixcalaan books!

## The Colour of Magic
### _Terry Pratchett_
I'm a little late to the [Discworld series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld), but I'm glad I finally got around to reading one of his books. 
I love a little bit of comedy mixed in with my fantasy and _The Colour of Magic_ certainly doesn't disappoint. The book is set in another universe where 
the world is a disc sitting atop four giant elephants, who in turn are on the back of a giant spacefaring turtle. We follow the story of Rincewind, 
an incompetent (and yet _very_ hard to kill) flunky wizard, as he attempts to guide the continent's first tourist. The duo, accompanied by Twoflower's 
luggage which is made of magical sentient wood that will follow Twoflower anywhere he goes, proceed to get themselves into all the trouble there is to 
get into. They explore magical caverns and enchanted trees, an upside down mountain filled with magic, and eventually making it to the edge of the world. 

_The Colour of Magic_ did a lot of world building which I found a little slow at the beginning, but by the end I found the characters and story to be quite enjoyable. 
Perhaps not as much as some of the other series I've been reading, but on the other hand the Discworld has 41 novels to explore, so there is hope that it 
will get much, much better. I can't wait!

## A Country of Ghosts
### _Margaret Killjoy_
This one was recommended by [Elle](https://bsky.app/profile/ellearmageddon.bsky.social) and it read pretty much as I would have expected from them lol. 
A Country of Ghosts follows a Borolian journalist who travels to a far away land as a war correspondent and gets involved with the local anarchists as they 
attempt to push back the invading Borolian forces. The book is basically half novel, half anarchism 101.

## The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger
### _Stephen King_
This one goes along with Pratchett's Discworld in that I really wanted a series that I knew would be good and would last me a while. Stephen King doesn't 
disappoint and this was quite the listen. The book (and I'm assuming series, although I'm not through it yet) follows Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, 
searching for a mysterious man in black. We soon discover that Roland doesn't live in our universe, but there does seem to be some connection â€” Jake, a 
young boy that Rolland discovers in a way station, died in our world (under dubious circumstances) and was transported to Roland's world. They travel 
through the wasteland fighting demons and succubi, search for oracles and the man in black, all while trying to find the mysterious dark tower. Roland eventually 
catches the man in black, who tells him about "the three" - thee people he will encounter on his way to the Dark Tower. The Prisoner, The Lady of Shadows, and The Pusher.  
The book ends with Roland defeating the man in black, but at a great cost.

## The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three
### _Stephen King_
The first book was so good and ended on a "where the hell is he going from here?" note that I had to immediately dive into the second novel. This one got 
super weird but also very fun. Not long after the previous novel Roland wakes up on a beach being attacked by some large, nasty crustaceans. The attack leaves 
him injured and weakened, but he soldiers on to find the three and eventually finds a door that appears to go to nowhere. However, when opened Roland realizes 
that he can see through someone else's eyes. When he goes through the door he inhabits the body of Eddie Dean, a young heroin addict in 1987 in the process of smuggling 
drugs into New York for a mob boss. Of course everything goes sideways and Roland helps Eddie get out of the situation and eventually escape to Roland's world.

Eventually Roland and Eddie find the next door where we meet Odetta Holmes, a black woman with 
[dissociative identity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder). Odetta lost her legs when someone pushed her in front of a 
subway train years ago. She is completely unaware of her alternate personality - Detta Walker - who is as violent and nasty as Odetta is kind and gentle. 
Odetta gets pulled into Roland's world as well and proceeds to wreak havoc on Roland and Eddie. Roland is becoming increasingly more sick from his injuries on 
the beach. Eddie goes ahead with Odetta to find the last door, and when he finds it he leaves Odetta there and brings back her wheelchair to bring Roland 
to the final door.

Given the pattern, we're sort of expecting a final companion, but what we get is Jack Mort - a sociopath who takes pleasure in injuring and killing strangers. 
We soon realize that Mort's story is interwoven with the others. Randall takes over Jack's body to procure some wares that are needed (such as medicine for his 
infection). Through the process Odetta and Detta are forced to confront the trauma that caused the split and they merge into a third, personality - Susannah Dean. 

The group leave the beach in search of the tower. At the end both Eddie and Susannah have been saved by Roland, who is aware that he very likely may have to sacrifice them at some point to reach the Tower.

## The Light Fantastic
### _Terry Pratchett_
Back to Discworld! We pick up shortly after the ending of *The Colour of Magic* as Rincewind and Twoflower are rescued by the Octavo from falling over the edge of the 
world. The actions of the Octavo cause quite a disturbance, which leads some wizards to summon Death to try to get an explanation of what happened. Death explains 
that the Discworld will soon be destroyed by a red star unless the eight spells of the Octavo are read. 

Rincewind and Twoflower go on a bunch of bumbling adventures, meeting Druids who are building a computer and Death's adopted daughter who wants to keep her new 
friends (by killing them of course!). They meet up with one of the greatest warriors in the land, who is old and toothless but incredibly fierce. As the world 
gets closer to the red star people star getting a little crazy and attacking anyone associated with magic. Eventually the 8 spells are all said and this causes 
eight moons of the red star to crack open, giving birth to eight infant worlds (turtles). The Luggage is given to Rincewind as a gift (after eating the Octavo) 
and Twoflower decides that it is time to return home. He gives the Luggage to Rincewind as a parting gift and Rincewind decides to enroll in University, 
supposing now that the spell is out of his mind he may finally be able to learn magic.

## The Saint of Bright Doors
### _Vajra Chandrasekera_
I had read quite a few of the [2024 Hugo nominees for Best Novel](https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2024-hugo-awards/) so I decided to read the rest. This 
was the first of the 3 I hadn't already read. I was quite imaginative and enjoyable. Fetter is raised from a young age by his mother to kill his father. Except he doesn't 
really want to, so he moves to the city and tries to live his life. He joins a support group for other cult members that were almost the ones to take over, but not quite. 
The setting is very unusual in that it combines mystic and magical themes in a modern setting. The book feels like it's wandering at times, but somehow is always moving 
along, even if we don't know where it's going. The story is incredibly original a quite fun to read, I liked it quite a bit.

## The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi 
### Shannon Chakraborty
This is the second of the Hugo nominees that I hadn't read, and I'm quite glad I did! 
This was a delightful tale of Amina al-Sirafi, a pirate on the Indian Ocean who is tracked down in her retirement by a wealthy widow who want's her help 
in getting her kidnapped granddaughter back from a very bad man. As we go along we realize no everything is as it was presented and taking the job has put 
Amina in a very bad place. She reunites with her old crew and they discover that the very bad man is a very bad sorcerer who controls tremendous magic, 
much to Amina's chagrin because she really, _really_ is not fond of magic. As the book progresses she finds it harder and harder to complete her task while 
keeping everyone safe. This was a fantastically fun read and I very much hope that there are more to come!

## Witch King
### Martha Wells
If you've read the reviews up until now you're well aware that I am _obsessed_ with Wells' series
[The Murderbot Diaries](https://amzn.to/3K2sFRF). Wells was a very accomplished author in the fantasy space before 
[All Systems Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Systems_Red) came out, but I wasn't sure what to expect from this. Some of the 
reviews I read said that it was hard to follow. The scope of _Witch King_ is certainly much, much more expansive than any given 
Murderbot book, but I didn't find it overly hard to follow. 

The story is set in a magical world of witches, magicians (called expositors), demons, mortal and immortal beings. The demons are beings who dwell in the 
underearth, but can be summoned to posses the bodies of the recently deceased. Among the nomadic tribes who practice this the 
demons become part of the deceased's extended family. They have magical powers and children born out of the unions between demons 
and mortals become witches, who also posses magical powers, usually in the ability to control certain elemental forces. 

The story follows Kai-Enna (Kai), a demon who lives among the nomadic plain tribes and inhabits the body of a young girl who's family 
wished to know what her final thoughts were, since when a demon inhabits the recently deceased they take on their knowledge. The story 
jumps between the present and the past as Kai retraces the path that lead him from a peaceful nomadic life to overthrowing 
the Hierarchs, the big bad(dies) who aim to overthrow the world, and the present where he seeks to maintain the peaceful coalition 
he helped to build. 

The story is a fairly straight forward good vs evil deal, which I found quite entertaining. Many reviewers point out that it has a decidedly [90s sci-fi feel](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/books/review/best-science-fiction-fantasy-2023.html), although 
I can't claim to have read enough sci-fi (yet) to agree or disagree with that. Lovers of Murderbot will find a lot to like in Kai, 
who is the [introvirtuous](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=introvirtuous) hero who reluctantly steps up to save the 
day, even if he'd rather just stay at home and chill. It didn't take long at all for me to get completely immersed in _Witch King_ 
and I was definitely sad when it was finished.

## The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands
### Stephen King
Continuing on where the last book left off book 3 follows Roland, Susannah and Eddie as they make their way from the Western Seat into Mid-World along the path of "The Beam". We find that Roland is slowly losing his mind. Due to having killed Jack Mort (in book 2) before Jack had a chance to kill Jake (in book 1) Roland has created a paradox and now has two sets of memories that are fighting it out in his head, one where Jake showed up at the way station and followed Roland into the mountain and eventually died, and one where he went into the mountain alone and Jake still lives. Back in NYC Jake is experiencing a similar fate, slowly going mad from two sets of memories trying to resolve themselves. 

Roland, Susannah and Eddie defeat a giant cybernetic bear named Shardik, which we learn is one of the twelve guardians of The Beams. We learn that the Beams criss-cross the continent and have something to do with the Dark Tower. After defeating Shardik the trio follows the path of the beam and come to a place of power where they are able to 
construct a door which allows Jake to enter the Gunslinger's world. The group (referred to as a ka-tet, meaning a group of people brought together by destiny) continue along 
the beam to the town of Lud. Lud is an ancient high tech city with an ancient AI named Blaine that has slowly gone insane over the centuries. To get where they are 
going they must defeat the inhabitants of Lud and convince the erratic Blaine to take them along the beam toward the Dark Tower. The book ends with a stand between 
Blaine and the ka-tet as Blaine takes them via monorail to Topeka, the end of the line.

I'm liking this series more each book. I was tempted to dive right in, but decided instead to start Green Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson to give myself a little break (while 
also continuing my dive into older classic series).


[You can purchase The Waste Lands here](https://amzn.to/4aNsiW3)

## Green Mars
### Kim Stanley Robinson
*Green Mars* is the second book in the Mars Trilogy, continues the epic story of humanity's colonization of Mars. Set several decades after the events of Red Mars, the novel explores the political and ecological transformation of the red planet as it undergoes terraforming. Mars is slowly "greening" as plants begin to thrive, and tensions rise between various factionsâ€”some pushing for full independence from Earth, while others want to maintain Earth's control.

The novel delves into the lives of the original settlers, known as the First Hundred, and the new generation born on Mars. It explores themes of environmental stewardship, political revolution, and scientific advancement. Through complex character development and deep philosophical insights, Green Mars portrays a realistic, hard science-fiction vision of planetary colonization, revolution, and the ethical challenges of reshaping a world.

The themes in Green Mars resonate strongly with today's economic and political climate, particularly in discussions around sustainability, autonomy, and the distribution of power. In the novel, Mars' colonists grapple with the ethics of terraforming, balancing technological progress with environmental stewardshipâ€”much like our current debates over climate change and the push for green energy. Politically, Green Mars explores tensions between corporate interests from Earth and Martian independence, echoing today's struggles between global corporations and local governance. Just as Marsâ€™ colonists seek sovereignty and a more equitable society, movements across the globe today demand more localized power, economic reform, and environmental justice in the face of growing inequality and corporate control. The novelâ€™s themes of revolution, resource management, and the consequences of unchecked corporate influence mirror our real-world challenges in navigating economic and political futures.

## The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass
### Stephen King
*The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass* is the fourth installment in the Dark Tower series, continuing the journey of Roland Deschain and his ka-tetâ€”Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy on their quest for the Dark Tower. Picking up where the previous novel left off, the group faces off against Blaine the Mono, an insane AI-controlled train that forces them into a deadly riddle contest. After defeating Blaine with a clever riddle from Eddie, they find themselves in a post-apocalyptic Kansas, a world reminiscent of The Stand. As they rest, Roland shares the haunting story of his past, revealing a pivotal chapter of his life in the Barony of Mejis.

The novel then shifts into an extended flashback, detailing Rolandâ€™s younger days. After discovering his gunslinger heritage, a teenage Roland and his friends, Alain and Cuthbert, are sent to Mejis to lay low from political tensions in their home of Gilead. While there, Roland meets Susan Delgado, and the two fall deeply in love. However, their romance is doomed from the start, as Susan is already promised to Mayor Thorin. This secret affair unfolds against the backdrop of a dangerous conspiracy involving the powerful, malevolent wizard Marten and a group of rebels plotting to overthrow the Affiliation, the ruling body of Gilead.

As Roland and his companions uncover a plot to steal oil stored in Mejis, which would be used in the coming war, they must navigate personal conflicts, betrayals, and the dangerous enforcers known as the Big Coffin Hunters. The flashback story is one of deep loss and tragedy, revealing Rolandâ€™s growth as a gunslinger and the hardening of his character. Susanâ€™s tragic death, burned at the stake by her townspeople, marks one of the most profound losses in Rolandâ€™s life, cementing his commitment to his quest for the Dark Tower, even at the cost of those he loves.

The novel ends back in the present, with Roland finishing his story and the ka-tet continuing their journey toward the Dark Tower. They come across the Emerald City, where they confront the wizard Marten (also known as Randall Flagg), who taunts them before disappearing. The novel closes with the ka-tetâ€™s resolve strengthened, but the emotional weight of Rolandâ€™s past lingers, illustrating the cost of his obsession with reaching the Tower. Wizard and Glass serves as both a continuation of the series and a deep dive into Rolandâ€™s backstory, highlighting the themes of love, loss, and destiny that permeate The Dark Tower saga.

I am very much enjoying the Dark Tower series and simultaneously looking forward to reading more while trying to not burn through the entire series all at once. Thankfully I have another series that will take me literally years to work through. Speaking of whichâ€¦

## Sourcery
### Terry Pratchett
I'm sticking with the Rincewind track on the [Reddit Discworld Reading Order Guide 2.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/10eon2l/discworld_reading_order_guide/), although I _may_ have bought a few of the Death novels because I'm really loving Death as a character. Anyway, on to the review!

*Sourcery* is the fifth novel in the Discworld series, and it follows the story of the return of sourceryâ€”an ancient and powerful form of magic long thought to be extinct. The novel begins with Ipslore the Red, a bitter and power-hungry wizard, defying the natural order by fathering a child, Coin. Coin is no ordinary child but a sourcerer, capable of wielding immense magical power far beyond that of regular wizards. Ipslore gives Coin a staff imbued with his own spirit and sends him to the Unseen University, where his arrival disrupts the balance of power, as the wizards begin to realize that a sourcerer can not only bend reality but also rule the world.

Meanwhile, Rincewind, the hapless wizard who barely knows any magic, finds himself unwittingly caught up in the chaos when the Archchancellor's Hat, a powerful magical artifact, commands him to flee the city with it. The Hat fears Coinâ€™s immense power and the growing instability at the Unseen University. Rincewind is accompanied by Conina, a skilled barbarian hairdresser and daughter of the legendary hero Cohen the Barbarian, and Nijel the Destroyer, an awkward young man attempting to live out his dreams of becoming a barbarian hero. Together, they try to protect the Hat and escape the growing threat of Coin's rising dominance.

As Coin's power grows, the wizards begin launching an all-out war on the world, breaking the long-held truce that magic should not interfere with ordinary peopleâ€™s lives. Coin, manipulated by Ipsloreâ€™s spirit within his staff, starts remaking the world according to his fatherâ€™s vision, causing chaos across the Disc. Rincewind, despite his lack of magical prowess, feels compelled to return to face the danger. In a climactic showdown, Rincewind and Coin confront each other, and Rincewindâ€™s bumbling courage helps Coin see the danger of the power he wields, leading him to break free from his fatherâ€™s control.

In the end, Coin sacrifices his staff and his magic, choosing a different path than the one his father intended. The balance of magic is restored, the wizards are humbled, and Rincewind, once again, finds himself lost in the great unknown. Sourcery explores themes of power, destiny, and free will, all while delivering Pratchettâ€™s signature blend of humor, satire, and sharp commentary on the nature of authority and human ambition. It offers a witty and engaging tale that also reflects on the corrupting influence of unchecked power and the importance of individual choice.

## Not Till We Are Lost (Bobiverse Book 5)
### Dennis E. Taylor
Sometimes I buy a book when it's announced and then basically explode with joy when it is released. This is definitely the case with the new Bobiverse book. As soon as I was done with Sourcery I dived right in and burned through this in record time (this book may have single handedly jump started me out of a funk and back into getting out of the house as an excuse to listen to more of it). I fell like Taylor had his work cut out for him on this one - things were so tenuous after book 4 but I feel like he did a fantastic job with this one. It has all the same humor and insightfulness of the earlier installments and continues the story well.

Not Till We Are Lost continues the adventures of Bob and his many clones. It interweaves the stories of Bob and some of the original clones who are trying to figure out how to navigate the current political situation with the humans and other newly discovered races, the integration of Quinlans into the virtual world and the Skippys attempts to create a super-intelligent AI. While in the background two clones who left long ago for the galactic core (Icarus and Daedalus) discover a network of ancient civilizations and a huge threat to the galaxy and its current occupants. 

If you like Dennis E. Taylor's previous Bobiverse offerings I'm fairly certain you will like this one as well. There were multiple instances where I laughed so hard I almost had to pull off the road. It's no surprise given the other books that he continues to explore themes of individuality, consciousness, and the burdens and obligations of immortality. As always Ray Porter who narrates the audiobook is fantastic and does a phenomenal job of voicing the characters.

## Bury Your Gays
### Chuck Tingle 
You can't go wrong with Chuck Tingle. Mr. Tingle is (of course) still writing queer horror and I'm here for it. If you like Mr. Tingle's other work it is certain that you will like this book. It's a standard Tingler - Misha Byrne is a semi-out[^out] Hollywood writer who has just been nominated for an Oscar and his career is going fantastically, except that the executives at ~~Warner~~ Harold Brothers[^lol] are insistent that Misha either make the two female leads of his hit show straight or kill them off after the reveal that they are gay. If you're not aware - [bury your gays](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays) is reference to the very pervasive trope where the queer character can't just ride into the sunset and be happy (RIP [Tara](https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Tara_Maclay), I never got over losing you &#128557;). Misha insists that he will not do that, as he had his heart broken by [queerbaiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queerbaiting) when he was very young.

Things start to get weird when fans show up dressed as one of his old horror characters. As time goes and more of these characters keep showing up it becomes apparent that the horror is real. Misha along with boyfriend Zeke and [ace](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/resources/article/understanding-asexuality/) best friend Tara they set out to figure out how exactly these specters from Misha's work are tormenting them and how to make them stop.

As always, Mr. Tingle delivers with a delightful story that definitely has a message, but isn't preachy and the story is engaging and fun. I can't wait for the next book to see where Chuck goes from here!

## Fight and Flight
### Scott Meyer
*Fight and Flight* by Scott Meyer is the fourth book in the *Magic 2.0* series, following the humorous escapades of computer programmers who discover they can alter reality by accessing a mysterious file that governs the world. In this installment, Martin Banks, the protagonist, along with his friendsâ€”who have taken on the roles of wizards in medieval Englandâ€”face the unexpected threat of an invading French army. This disruption to their magical, easygoing lifestyle forces them to devise a strategy to protect their chosen time period from conquest, even though they are generally more accustomed to playing pranks and indulging in carefree antics.

The group, which includes fellow time-traveling wizards Gwen, Phillip, Roy, and others, is hardly suited for real battle. However, they recognize that using their powers irresponsibly could lead to dangerous unintended consequences, especially if the time-traveling secret is discovered by the locals or the invading forces. Martin and his friends attempt to organize the townspeople and their limited resources to create a defense, all while trying to avoid tipping off the invaders that they possess magical powers. Throughout this process, their different personalities and egos clash, adding a layer of humor and chaos to the serious task at hand.

As the story progresses, *Fight and Flight* balances comedy with suspense, exploring the groupâ€™s struggle to manage their power responsibly while staying true to their carefree, unheroic nature. Meyerâ€™s lighthearted writing style and the charactersâ€™ humorous banter highlight the absurdity of their situation, where advanced powers and programming skills must meet medieval warfare. The book ultimately illustrates themes of friendship, responsibility, and the consequences of meddling with time, while delivering a fun, witty adventure filled with clever twists and laugh-out-loud moments.

Overall I liked the book, however it felt like more of a slog at the beginning than the previous books. Thankfully by the end I started to enjoy it and I am looking forward to the next book.

## Eric
### Terry Pratchett
*Eric* by Terry Pratchett is a satirical fantasy novel from the Discworld series that follows the misadventures of a young demonologist, Eric Thursley, and the inept wizard Rincewind. Eric, a typical teenage boy with grand ideas, attempts to summon a demon to fulfill his desires for eternal life, control of the world, and the love of the most beautiful woman. However, due to a magical mishap, he inadvertently summons Rincewind, the most cowardly and incompetent wizard on the Disc. Unfortunately for Eric, Rincewind has no power to grant wishes, but the magic of the situation ends up propelling them both on an unexpected, chaotic journey through time and space.

As they travel, each of Ericâ€™s wishes seems to be twisted in a way that leads to ironic disasters. For instance, when Eric wishes to rule an empire, he finds himself in the middle of a deadly Aztec-like civilization that plans to sacrifice him; when he asks for the love of the most beautiful woman, he ends up encountering Helen of Troy but finds her nothing like the ideal he imagined. Throughout their journey, they are accompanied by Rincewind's Luggageâ€”a sentient, violent chest on legs that provides comic relief and unexpected assistance. Rincewind and Eric also journey through the underworld, where they meet demons and eventually encounter the ultimate bureaucracy of Hell itself, cleverly satirizing the concept of modern organizational hells and mundane torture.

Pratchett uses humor, irony, and parody in *Eric* to explore themes such as the dangers of wish-fulfillment, the folly of power, and the unpredictability of human desire. The bookâ€™s humorous, light-hearted tone belies a deeper commentary on human nature and ambition, as Ericâ€™s journey serves as a reminder of the unexpected consequences of getting what we think we want. Pratchett's signature wit and clever subversion of fantasy tropes make *Eric* both an amusing and thought-provoking read, showcasing his skill in blending comedy with insightful social critique within the whimsical and absurd Discworld universe.

I loved this book even more than the previous chapters and it was finished far too quickly. I must admit that even though I'm only four books into a 40 something book universe I'm feeling a little sad that eventually I will run out of Discworld books and understanding why the series is so loved.
