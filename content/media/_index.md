Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. Audble continues to be fantastic and I'm burning through 20+ 
books a year. Fair warning if you don't know me -  but if you're the kind of person who uses "woke" or "social justice warrior" in an un-ironic or 
derogatory manner then you're probably not going to like pretty much anything I'm reading.

# 2024 Media List

In usual fashion I slapped the [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}}) together last minute just in time for 2024. I'll try to do better this year
(lol). In other news **WHEN THE FUCK DID IT BECOME 2024**. This is not okay.

This year I'm going to try to add movies that I watched, but that's a little harder to keep track of and I guarantee I'll miss a lot of stuff I've watched.
