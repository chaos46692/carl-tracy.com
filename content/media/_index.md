Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. Audble continues to be fantastic and I'm burning through 20+ 
books a year. Fair warning if you don't know me -  but if you're the kind of person who uses "woke" or "social justice warrior" in an un-ironic or 
derogatory manner then you're probably not going to like pretty much anything I'm reading.

# 2024 Media List

In usual fashion I slapped the [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}}) together last minute just in time for 2024. I'll try to do better this year
(lol). In other news **WHEN THE FUCK DID IT BECOME 2024**. This is not okay.

## Brute Force
### _Scott Meyer_
This was a pretty entertaining stand alone book by [Scott Meyer](https://scottmeyer.rocks/) and the first one outside the [Magic 2.0](https://amzn.to/48ZNCH9)[^magic20] 
universe.  A peaceful alliance of aliens has a problem - they've been overtaken by a violent species and need help from humans. Humans aren't doing so well, as they've 
managed to bomb themselves into near oblivion (which they refer to as "the bad week"), but they are the most violent species that they know, so they figure we can help them 
fix their civilization. Our hero Cross Agarwal leads a band of post-apocalyptic raiders who less than a week ago were trying to kill each other to save the aliens from this 
other species. In standard Scott Meyer form we get some great characters such as the cannibal _Meat Machine_ and _The Pile_ - sentient, quantum entangled sand that is aware 
of everything that happens anywhere one of it's piles happens to be. I liked this book quite a bit and am very much looking forward to Meyer's new books.

## Camp Damascus
### _Chuck Tingle_
I loved my first Chuck Tingle book and this one again did not disappoint. Rose is a very devout girl living in Neverton, Montana - a God-fearing community with the 
best gay conversion camp in the world (100% success rate!). Not everything is as it seems, and we follow Rose as she begins to question the motivations of her family 
and church before discovering the horrific truth about it all. There were some sections where I feel like the book dragged, but given this is Chuck's first 
book he sure as shit did better than I could have. I'm very much looking forward to his [next book](https://amzn.to/3vJk0j2).
