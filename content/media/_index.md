Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. I've always had a hard time reading books and recently started 
using [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) to listen to audio books. I had put it off for a long time, figuring that I wouldn't use it and I would just 
waste money. Oh boy was I wrong. I burned through tons of books and very much outpaced the one credit a month I got from Audible and have

# 2023 Reading List

Welp, I finished up my 2022 list just in time to clear it out for 2023 =) We'll start with where we left off - _The Lunar Chronicles_



## Scarlet (The Lunar Chronicles)
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
Continuing the Lunar Chronicles this story loosely follows the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Scarlet is a young girl who is searching for her Grandmother 
who has disappeared from their farm in rural France. Scarlet meets up with Wolf, a mysterious stranger who makes his living fighting in illegal
underground fights. Scarlet teams up with Wolf to find her Grandmother and quickly realizes that there is more going on than she expected, 
and that both Wolf and her grand-m√®re have dangerous secrets. Eventually everybody (including most of the characters from _Cinder_) all meet up 
and make a plan to save the world.

## Crescent (The Lunar Chronicles)
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
Crescent (Cress) is a Lunar shell (born both without mind control abilities, but also unable to be influenced by Lunar mind control) who was abducted 
by one of the Lunar Queen's head Thaumaturge (government official) and imprisoned in a satellite orbiting Earth where she acts as a spy for the Lunar
crown. Cress does not like what she's doing but she is good at it and has no control over her situation, _until_ she meets up with our heros from
the previous books. Together they make a plan to stop the wedding between Kai (now Emperor Kaito after the death of his father) and the Lunar Queen. 
Can they succeed? **OF COURSE THEY WILL IT'S YA** but it's still a fun ride.
