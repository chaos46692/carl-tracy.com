Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. I've always had a hard time reading books and recently started 
using [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) to listen to audio books. I had put it off for a long time, figuring that I wouldn't use it and I would just 
waste money. Oh boy was I wrong. I burned through tons of books and very much outpaced the one credit a month I got from Audible. 

#2022
My 2022 reading list started out with lots of self improvement and quickly devolved into tons of sci fi. I regret nothing =). [John Scalzi](/tags/john-scalzi) 
and [Dennis E. Taylor](/tags/dennis-e.-taylor) are probably my favorites this year, although Scalzi has way more books than Taylor. I'm hoping another 
[Bobiverse]({{<ref bobiverse>}}) book comes out soon because I was really enjoying it and hope he can keep the momentum going with the next book.

[My 2022 reading list]({{<ref books-22>}})

- [Thinking in Systems](https://www.audible.com/pd/Thinking-in-Systems-Audiobook/B07FWBN4Q5) _Donella H. Meadows_
- [Why We're Polarized](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-Were-Polarized-Audiobook/1797103164) _Ezra Klein_ 
- [Still Just a Geek](https://www.audible.com/pd/Still-Just-a-Geek-Audiobook/B09HZ38NGB) _Whil Wheaton_ {{< line_break >}}
  Wil Wheaton reads his memoir "Just a Geek" and adds hours of annotation and commentary. It's a beautiful and heart wrenching look at a young man 
  growing up in a world he never really wanted. Wil never backs away from holding himself to account for the shitty sexist jokes he made, often 
  stopping to literally yell at his younger self. 

  This is one of the the most heartbreaking things I listened to over the last year. Some of the subject matter is extraordinarily hard because Wil is 
  talking very openly about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents, which would be hard enough to read but listening to the raw emotion 
  as he recounts the [physical and emotional abuse](https://wilwheaton.net/2022/08/when-you-watch-the-curse-you-are-watching-two-children-who-were-abused-and-exploited-daily-during-production-no-adults-protected-us/)
  of himself and his sister is absolutely heart wrenching.

  Listening to Wil's struggles gave me the courage to seek out a Therapist. I highly recommend it, just be aware that it can get pretty heavy at times.
- [You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Youre-Never-Weird-on-the-Internet-Almost-Audiobook/B00XUTQ692) _Felicia Day_ {{< line_break >}}
  Felicia Day proves that she's exactly as hilarious and awesome as we already knew she was =)
- [The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-End-of-Everything-Audiobook/1797106503) _Katie Mack_
- [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.audible.com/pd/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Audiobook/B073V797JS) _Samin Nosrat_ 

  Absolutely game changing book for me. I love to cook, but this book helped eleveate my cooking by bringing together ideas that I had never quite put together.
- [Old Man's War Series]({{<ref old-mans-war>}}) _John Scalzi_ {{< line_break >}}
   Old Man's War was [John Scalzi's](https://whatever.scalzi.com/) debut novel and it is fantastic. I'll be honest, I knew Scalzi from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scalzi) 
   long before I read any of his novels. He seems to be a decent person who loves burritos[^scalzi] and he writes some pretty great novels.
- [Interdependency Trilogy]({{<ref interdependency>}}) _John Scalzi_
- [Three Body Problem Series]({{<ref three-body-problem>}})  _Cixin Liu_
- [The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Three-Stigmata-of-Palmer-Eldritch-Audiobook/B013J9W4SY) _Philip K. Dick_
- [The Sirens of Titan](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Sirens-of-Titan-Audiobook/B002V8L3P0) _Kurt Vonnegut_
- [Agent to the Stars](https://www.audible.com/pd/Agent-to-the-Stars-Audiobook/B004DR2CNE) _John Scalzi_

  What if aliens exist butâ€¦ they are so sufficiently weird that they need some major PR. This quirky one-off book by Scalzi is tons of fun

- [Bobiverse Series]({{<ref bobiverse>}}) _Dennis E. Taylor_ 
- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Subtle-Art-of-Not-Giving-a-F-ck-Audiobook/B01I28NFEE) _Mark Manson_
