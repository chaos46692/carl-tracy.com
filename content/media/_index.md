Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. Audble continues to be fantastic and I'm burning through 20+ 
books a year. Fair warning if you don't know me -  but if you're the kind of person who uses "woke" or "social justice warrior" in an un-ironic or 
derogatory manner then you're probably not going to like pretty much anything I'm reading.

# 2024 Media List

In usual fashion I slapped the [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}}) together last minute just in time for 2024. I'll try to do better this year
(lol). In other news **WHEN THE FUCK DID IT BECOME 2024**. This is not okay.

## Brute Force
### _Scott Meyer_
This was a pretty entertaining stand alone book by [Scott Meyer](https://scottmeyer.rocks/) and the first one outside the [Magic 2.0](https://amzn.to/48ZNCH9)[^magic20] 
universe.  A peaceful alliance of aliens has a problem - they've been overtaken by a violent species and need help from humans. Humans aren't doing so well, as they've 
managed to bomb themselves into near oblivion (which they refer to as "the bad week"), but they are the most violent species that they know, so they figure we can help them 
fix their civilization. Our hero Cross Agarwal leads a band of post-apocalyptic raiders who less than a week ago were trying to kill each other to save the aliens from this 
other species. In standard Scott Meyer form we get some great characters such as the cannibal _Meat Machine_ and _The Pile_ - sentient, quantum entangled sand that is aware 
of everything that happens anywhere one of it's piles happens to be. I liked this book quite a bit and am very much looking forward to Meyer's new books.

## Camp Damascus
### _Chuck Tingle_
I loved my first Chuck Tingle book and this one again did not disappoint. Rose is a very devout girl living in Neverton, Montana - a God-fearing community with the 
best gay conversion camp in the world (100% success rate!). Not everything is as it seems, and we follow Rose as she begins to question the motivations of her family 
and church before discovering the horrific truth about it all. There were some sections where I feel like the book dragged, but given this is Chuck's first 
book he sure as shit did better than I could have. I'm very much looking forward to his [next book](https://amzn.to/3vJk0j2).

## A Desolation Call Peace
### _Arkady Martine_
Once again we join Mahit Dzmare and Three Seagrass as they attempt to communicate with strange alines that seem bend on destroying everything they come across. If they 
succeed they could save the Teixcalaan Empire from destruction and allow it's continued expansion. If they fail it could mean an endless war. The story jumps between 
Mahit and Three Seagrass, Yaotlek Nine Hibiscus - a fleet captain who has been charged with preventing this newly discovered species from interrupting the empire 
and her right hand Twenty Cicada, and Eight Antidote - the soon-to-be Emperor who is learning about how the empire functions and who he will eventually become as 
Emperor of Teixcalaan.

I liked this book quite a bit. I'm a bit sad that this will be the last of the duology, but I'm looking forward to more Teixcalaan books!

## The Colour of Magic
### Terry Pratchett
I'm a little late to the [Discworld series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld), but I'm glad I finally got around to reading one of his books. 
I love a little bit of comedy mixed in with my fantasy and _The Colour of Magic_ certainly doesn't disappoint. The book is set in another universe where 
the world is a disc sitting atop four giant elephants, who in turn are on the back of a giant spacefaring turtle. We follow the story of Rincewind, 
an incompetent (and yet _very_ hard to kill) flunky wizard, as he attempts to guide the continent's first tourist. The duo, accompanied by Twoflower's 
luggage which is made of magical sentient wood that will follow Twoflower anywhere he goes, proceed to get themselves into all the trouble there is to 
get into. They explore magical caverns and enchanted trees, an upside down mountain filled with magic, and eventually making it to the edge of the world. 

_The Colour of Magic_ did a lot of world building which I found a little slow at the beginning, but by the end I found the characters and story to be quite enjoyable. 
Perhaps not as much as some of the other series I've been reading, but on the other hand the Discworld has 41 novels to explore, so there is hope that it 
will get much, much better. I can't wait!
