Inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. I've always had a hard time reading books and recently started 
using [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) to listen to audio books. I had put it off for a long time, figuring that I wouldn't use it and I would just 
waste money. Oh boy was I wrong. I burned through tons of books and very much outpaced the one credit a month I got from Audible and have gone up 
to the highest level they offer. 

If you know me this probably goes without saying, but if you're the kind of person who uses "woke" or "social justice warrior" in an un-ironic or 
derogatory manner then you're probably not going to like pretty much anything I'm reading.

## [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}})

# 2024 Reading List

In usual fashion I slapped the [2023 reading list]({{<ref books-23>}}) together last minute just in time for 2024. In other news 
**WHEN THE FUCK DID IT BECOME 2024**. This is not okay.



## System Collapse (Murderbot Series)
### _Martha Wells_ 
This will obviously be my next book after I finish Red Mars, let's see if it makes it onto the 2023 list or drug into 2024!
