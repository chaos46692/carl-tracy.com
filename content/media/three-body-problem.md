One of my work friends had recommended The Three-Body Problem to me and it sounded interesting â€” it starts with the Chinese cultural revolution 
and goes through the heat death of the universe. You know, usual stuff there. The original is written in Chinese and while I found that the 
story was great sometimes the prose was a little lacking. I'm not sure if that's due to the translation, language and cultural differences in 
writing between English and Chinese, or if the Cixin Liu's style just isn't quite what I was used to coming off of reading a lot of [Scalzi](/tags/john-scalzi/)
