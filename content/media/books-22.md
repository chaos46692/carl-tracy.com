#2022

These are the books I listened to in 2022. The ones that are series I created a review as a separate page to keep this from getting too cluttered.

- [Thinking in Systems](https://www.audible.com/pd/Thinking-in-Systems-Audiobook/B07FWBN4Q5?qid=1670168609&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=RDCYC9KWQ83W20DEW63K) _Donella H. Meadows_

- [The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-End-of-Everything-Audiobook/1797106503?ref=a_library_t_c5_libItem_1797106503&pf_rd_p=80765e81-b10a-4f33-b1d3-ffb87793d047&pf_rd_r=JMC041H7DZ42J06KKGVE) _Katie Mack_
- [Old Man's War Series](https://www.audible.com/series/Old-Mans-War-Audiobooks/B0073XG3JE) _John Scalzi_{{< line_break >}}
   Old Man's War was [John Scalzi's](https://whatever.scalzi.com/) debut novel and it is fantastic. I'll be honest, I knew Scalzi from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scalzi) 
   long before I read any of his novels. He seems to be a decent person who loves burritos[^scalzi] and he writes some pretty great novels.
- [Bobiverse Series]({{<ref interdependency>}}) _John Scalzi_
- [The Tree-Body Problem Series](https://www.audible.com/series/Three-Body-Audiobooks/B014I4P332) _Cixin Liu_
- [The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Three-Stigmata-of-Palmer-Eldritch-Audiobook/B013J9W4SY) _Philip K. Dick_
- [Agent to the Stars](https://www.audible.com/pd/Agent-to-the-Stars-Audiobook/B004DR2CNE) _John Scalzi
- [Bobiverse Series]({{<ref bobiverse>}}) _Dennis E. Taylor_
