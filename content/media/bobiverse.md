The Bobiverse follows the exploits of Bob, a computer engineer who lives the dream by becoming fantastically wealthy only to die shortly after 
and awake after his consciousness has been uploaded into a computer which is going to be use to control a [von Neumann probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft) (a self-replicating spacecraft). The series follows Bob as he expands through the universe, saves humanity and a few other species 
from existential threats, and ponders the meaning of the universe. 

[Dennis E. Taylor](/tags/dennis-e.-taylor) is a computer programmer who found a second career as an author. His books have a great sense of humor and the 
Bobiverse is packed full of humorous nerdy references, kind of like _Ready Player One_ but somehow for me manages to be more nerdy and less obnoxious at the 
same time. Perhaps it's because Bob is a giant nerd and he knows that he's a nerd and is unapologetic about it. 

So far there are 4 books in the series and I enjoyed them all immensely.


## We Are Legion (We Are Bob)
In the first book Bob awakes after a horrific traffic accident after just having purchased insurance that would have his head preserved should anything 
happen to him to find himself uploaded in a computer many years in the future. A good chunk of what was America has been taken over by a theocracy, 
**F**ree **A**merican **I**ndependent **T**heocratic **H**egemony, which has a horrible penchant for terrible acronyms. THe world is 
Bob's preserved head and the consciousness in it is no longer considered a person and was sold to a research group who 
builds computers which have ahd a human mind. Those unfortunate enough to have had their heads preserved could go from being a powerful CEO or billionaire 
to being a garbage truck in the afterlife if they are lucky(?) enough to not go insane during the process.

The world powers are struggling to build self-replicating ships in a bid to find other inhabitable worlds. Within 

## For We Are Many 

## All These Worlds

## Heaven's River

The Bobiverse series is the first book I had ever read who had a main protagonist who was a [Humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism)
