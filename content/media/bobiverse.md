The Bobiverse follows the exploits of Bob, a computer engineer who lives the dream by becoming fantastically wealthy only to die shortly after 
and awake after his consciousness has been uploaded into a computer which is going to be use to control a [von Neumann probe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft) (a self-replicating spacecraft). The series follows Bob as he expands through the universe, saves humanity and a few other species 
from existential threats, and ponders the meaning of the universe.
