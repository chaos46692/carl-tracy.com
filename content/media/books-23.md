Once again inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. I'm still on the [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) 
train and at their maximum subscriber level and buying books when they go on sale to boot. I love listening to books while I commute / travel. In the past 
I would get annoyed when Waze would butt in with commentary, but now I've started to find it amusing. So many random insertions _Arkady said *in one mile, use the 
right lane to turn right at the light*_. I laugh every time.

## The Lunar Chronicles 
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
This is a YA series based on fairy tales in a world with magic (or magic-like abilities). It was quite a wonderful listen and quite entertaining. 

## Scarlet (The Lunar Chronicles)
Continuing the Lunar Chronicles this story loosely follows the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Scarlet is a young girl who is searching for her Grandmother 
who has disappeared from their farm in rural France. Scarlet meets up with Wolf, a mysterious stranger who makes his living fighting in illegal
underground fights. Scarlet teams up with Wolf to find her Grandmother and quickly realizes that there is more going on than she expected, 
and that both Wolf and her grand-m√®re have dangerous secrets. Eventually everybody (including most of the characters from _Cinder_) all meet up 
and make a plan to save the world.

## Cress (The Lunar Chronicles)
Crescent (Cress) is a Lunar shell (born both without mind control abilities, but also unable to be influenced by Lunar mind control) who was abducted 
by one of the Lunar Queen's head Thaumaturge (government official) and imprisoned in a satellite orbiting Earth where she acts as a spy for the Lunar
crown. Cress does not like what she's doing but she is good at it and has no control over her situation, _until_ she meets up with our heros from
the previous books. Together they make a plan to stop the wedding between Kai (now Emperor Kaito after the death of his father) and the Lunar Queen. 
Can they succeed? **OF COURSE THEY WILL IT'S YA** but it's still a fun ride. 

## Fairest (The Lunar Chronicles)
Why is the Queen so messed up? How did she get her scars? We get to find out! This is a prequel told from the perspective of the evil Queen Levana. 
Meyer manages to tell a story that isn't exactly sympathetic to her, but masterfully shows her descent into the darker corners of the human mind. 
It also reveals the back story to Princess Winter and why everyone loves her so much.

## Winter (The Lunar Chronicles)
The fourth and final installment of the base series takes place on the moon (Luna) as our protagonists try to prevent the evil queen from 
marrying (now) Emperor Kaito. We learn that Winter is experiencing Lunar Sickness because she refuses to use her lunar gifts. Winter escapes 
with Scarlet and they all get together and save the world(s), right? Again, this is YA so you can probably guess how it goes, but you'll 
have to read it for more details.


## Stars Above (The Lunar Chronicles)
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
A collection of beautify short stories. We get to find out if Linh and Kaito get together, how Princess Selene came into the care of Scarlet's 
mother, how (the now) Lihn Cinder met her family and many other fantastic stories.

## A Psalm for the Wild-Built / A Prayer for the Crown-Shy  (Monk and Robot duology)
### _Becky Chambers_ 
My first introduction to Becky Chambers. I love these books so much. They were my first introduction to [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk). 
Set in the world of Panga, the stories revolve around a monk (Sibling Dex) who meets a robot (Splendid Speckled Mosscap). This is unusual because many 
generations ago the robots had collectively decided that they did not want to be slaves, and had wandered off to live in the wild. When they 
left Panga was on the verge of environmental collapse, but the robots leaving had completely upended the culture and forced humans to find a way to 
live more in harmony with the world. When Mosscap meets Dex for the first time it tells them that it is on a quest to find out what humans need. No pressure or anything. 
The two books follow the pair as they explore a world where humanity has found a balance with nature to learn what humans need. What's really 
charming to me about these books is that which the world Chambers has build is largely idealistic, it is not without conflict and there's no sense 
of We ALl gET AloNG GREAAAT kumbaya bullshit. There is conflict and there is pain and there is longing. Dex is always longing and restlessness looking for something more. 
I love the beautifully crafted world Chambers has built, even if it is somewhat unrealistic to my very jaded eyes. 

## A Psalm for the Wild-Built / A Prayer for the Crown-Shy  (Monk and Robot duology)
### _Becky Chambers_ 

## Redshirts
### _John Scalzi_ 

This is a one-off novel that is a satirical take on Star Trek. You may be aware of [redshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(stock_character)) in 
Star Trek as the stock characters that come in for one episode and die in short order.
