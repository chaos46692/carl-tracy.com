Once again inspired by my friend [Jen](https://jenmyers.net), here is the media I've been consuming. I'm still on the [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) 
train and at their maximum subscriber level and buying books when they go on sale to boot. I love listening to books while I commute / travel. In the past 
I would get annoyed when Waze would butt in with commentary, but now I've started to find it amusing. So many random insertions _Arkady said *in one mile, use the 
right lane to turn right at the light*_. I laugh every time.

## The Lunar Chronicles 
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
This is a YA series based on fairy tales in a world with magic (or magic-like abilities). It was quite a wonderful listen and quite entertaining. 

## Scarlet (The Lunar Chronicles)
Continuing the Lunar Chronicles this story loosely follows the story of Little Red Riding Hood. Scarlet is a young girl who is searching for her Grandmother 
who has disappeared from their farm in rural France. Scarlet meets up with Wolf, a mysterious stranger who makes his living fighting in illegal
underground fights. Scarlet teams up with Wolf to find her Grandmother and quickly realizes that there is more going on than she expected, 
and that both Wolf and her grand-m√®re have dangerous secrets. Eventually everybody (including most of the characters from _Cinder_) all meet up 
and make a plan to save the world.

## Cress (The Lunar Chronicles)
Crescent (Cress) is a Lunar shell (born both without mind control abilities, but also unable to be influenced by Lunar mind control) who was abducted 
by one of the Lunar Queen's head Thaumaturge (government official) and imprisoned in a satellite orbiting Earth where she acts as a spy for the Lunar
crown. Cress does not like what she's doing but she is good at it and has no control over her situation, _until_ she meets up with our heros from
the previous books. Together they make a plan to stop the wedding between Kai (now Emperor Kaito after the death of his father) and the Lunar Queen. 
Can they succeed? **OF COURSE THEY WILL IT'S YA** but it's still a fun ride. 

## Fairest (The Lunar Chronicles)
Why is the Queen so messed up? How did she get her scars? We get to find out! This is a prequel told from the perspective of the evil Queen Levana. 
Meyer manages to tell a story that isn't exactly sympathetic to her, but masterfully shows her descent into the darker corners of the human mind. 
It also reveals the back story to Princess Winter and why everyone loves her so much.

## Winter (The Lunar Chronicles)
The fourth and final installment of the base series takes place on the moon (Luna) as our protagonists try to prevent the evil queen from 
marrying (now) Emperor Kaito. We learn that Winter is experiencing Lunar Sickness because she refuses to use her lunar gifts. Winter escapes 
with Scarlet and they all get together and save the world(s), right? Again, this is YA so you can probably guess how it goes, but you'll 
have to read it for more details.


## Stars Above (The Lunar Chronicles)
### _Marissa Meyer_ 
A collection of beautify short stories. We get to find out if Linh and Kaito get together, how Princess Selene came into the care of Scarlet's 
mother, how (the now) Lihn Cinder met her family and many other fantastic stories.

## A Psalm for the Wild-Built / A Prayer for the Crown-Shy  (Monk and Robot duology)
### _Becky Chambers_ 
My first introduction to Becky Chambers. I love these books so much. They were my first introduction to [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk). 
Set in the world of Panga, the stories revolve around a monk (Sibling Dex) who meets a robot (Splendid Speckled Mosscap). This is unusual because many 
generations ago the robots had collectively decided that they did not want to be slaves, and had wandered off to live in the wild. When they 
left Panga was on the verge of environmental collapse, but the robots leaving had completely upended the culture and forced humans to find a way to 
live more in harmony with the world. When Mosscap meets Dex for the first time it tells them that it is on a quest to find out what humans need. No pressure or anything. 
The two books follow the pair as they explore a world where humanity has found a balance with nature to learn what humans need. What's really 
charming to me about these books is that which the world Chambers has build is largely idealistic, it is not without conflict and there's no sense 
of We ALl gET AloNG GREAAAT kumbaya bullshit. There is conflict and there is pain and there is longing. Dex is always longing and restlessness looking for something more. 
I love the beautifully crafted world Chambers has built, even if it is somewhat unrealistic to my very jaded eyes. 

## Redshirts
### _John Scalzi_ 

This is a one-off novel that is a satirical take on Star Trek. You may be aware of [redshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(stock_character)) in 
Star Trek as the stock characters that come in for one episode and dies almost immediately. 

## Wham!, George Michael and Me
### _Andrew Ridgeley_ 
Absolutely lovely memoir from Andrew Ridgeley about his childhood relationship with George Michael and their journey together while creating Wham!. 
It's a fascinating story of the behind the scenes moments that made Wham! and George Michael what they were. 


## Wayfarer Series
### _Becky Chambers_

This is a series of loosely connected books set in a 

### The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet
The first book in the Wayfarer series, it follows a rag tag crew of the Wayfarer as they work their way around the galaxy. 
Chambers' books always have a refreshing view on gender, culture and sexuality as well as an overall optimistic view of 
the future. 

### A Closed and Common Orbit
### Record of a Spaceborn Few
### The Galaxy, and the Ground Within

## Chilling Effect Series
### _Valarie Valdes_

### Chilling Effect
### Prime Deceptions
### Fault Tolerance

## Magic 2.0 Series
### _Scott Meyer_ 

### Off to Be the Wizard
### Spell or High Water
### An Unwelcome Quest

## Kaiju Preservation Society
### _John Scalzi_ 
Scalzi describes this book as a "pop song" - it's not some earth changing opus that will change the world or how you think about it, but 
rather a delightful romp that explores a world where Kaiju (think Godzilla and his pals if you're not familiar) are real and 
the world governments have teamed up to both hide and study them. Of course things go sideways when the big bad (aka corporate America) 
gets involved and tries to mess with the status quo.

## Some Desperate Glory
### _Emily Tesh_ 
This is one of the best books I've read in quite a while.   _It's got everything: 
a xenophobic death cult, eugenics, reality bending machines, reality do-overs, a gay himbo brother, the obnoxious gay xenocidal nerd, 
it's got it all!. Some folks might find it hard to read. The main character Kyr  is obnoxious, homophobic, transphobic and every other 
kind of phobic you can think of, but it should be remembered - that's _literally the point of the character_. It's told from Kyr's 
point of view and she's never known anything other than the cult she was raised in. 


## Devolution
### _Max Brooks_ 
Max Brooks wrote "World War Z" which is a fantastic book[^WWZ] about the world after a (near) zombie apocalypse

## Translation State
### _Ann Leckie_ 
Ann Leckie returns to the Radch universe to explore the world of the Presger Translators, which I very much enjoyed since 
Translator Dlique was one of my favorite characters from the original trilogy. 

## Starter Villain
### _John Scalzi_[^scalzi] 
What happens when your Uncle dies and leaves his Super Villain empire to you? Shenanigans of course!
 
## Red Mars
### _Kim Stanley Robinson_ 
Kim Stanley Robinson writes a very detailed book about the technology and politics of colonizing and terraforming Mars. This is the 
first book about the initial settlers and the struggles they face. I like the book but Robinson's writing style is very descriptive 
and there's not a lot of action, so if your looking for action maybe stay away. I liked this book and will definitely read the other 
two (Blue Mars and Green Mars), but I'll probably hit a few other books first (**MURDERBOT!!!!**)


[^scalzi]: YES ANOTHER ONE LEAVE ME ALONE I LIKE HIS WORK OKAY??!?!
[^WWZ]: Even if you like the movie it sucks okay? It's alright on it's own but putting Brad Pitt in this was the worst possible 
decision because now you have Brad Pitt and you have to justify paying for Brad Pitt so what do you do? Make the entire movie 
about Brad Pitt. Unfortunately that is 100% against how the book is structured.
