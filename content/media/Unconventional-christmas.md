I like unconventional stories and I especially love a good movie that turns normal conventions on it's head.
I've separated this into two sections - my absolute favorites / go to holiday season movies, followed by 
other movies as we watch them. This will probably take me most of December to write so it will morph over time.

We already had a good start of our favorite unconventional Christmas movies and because it's sort of our thing 
our friend Louise sent [this list](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/christmas-ideas/g29994860/best-christmas-horror-movies/) 
to us and we started watching even more!

## Rare Exports: A Christmas Ta
### 10/10 ★
Absolute perfection and the original film that got me into the whole Christmas Horror scene. A dark Finnish comedy.

# New for 2023


## Silent Night
### 7/10 ★
Apocalyptic black comedy starring Kiera Knightley about a group of old school friends getting together for a Christmas gathering. 
Seems like a tame setup except for one thing - an environmental collapse has caused a poison cloud to roam the country killing 
everyone in it's wake. To prevent people from dying horrible deaths the government has distributed poison suicide pills. 
The movie has some surprisingly funny parts in it, if you overlook the fact that the plot is way too real for comfort.
