I like unconventional stories and I especially love a good movie that turns normal conventions on it's head.


## Silent Night
### 7/10 â˜…
Apocalyptic black comedy starring Kiera Knightley about a group of old school friends getting together for a Christmas gathering. 
Seems like a tame setup except for one thing - an environmental collapse has caused a poison cloud to roam the country killing 
everyone in it's wake. To prevent people from dying horrible deaths the government has distributed poison suicide pills. 
The movie has some surprisingly funny parts in it, if you overlook the fact that the plot is way too real for comfort.
