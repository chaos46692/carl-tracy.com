I like unconventional stories and I especially love a good movie that turns normal conventions on it's head.
I've separated this into two sections - my absolute favorites / go to holiday season movies, followed by 
other movies as we watch them. This will probably take me most of December to write so it will morph over time.

We already had a good start of our favorite unconventional Christmas movies and because it's sort of our thing 
our friend Louise sent [this list](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/holidays/christmas-ideas/g29994860/best-christmas-horror-movies/) 
to us and we started watching even more!

I've included links to Amazon where you can purchase these fine movies, they are affiliate links, which in theory I get paid for but I'm guessing nobody 
will ever click them so whatever lol.

# Prime Cuts
These are my absolute favorite holiday movies that we come back to watch pretty much every year

## [Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale](https://amzn.to/4a4CVUY)
### 10/10 ★
Absolute perfection and the original film that got me into the whole Christmas Horror scene. A dark Finnish action/horror/comedy about 
a young boy and his father discovering the true story of Santa Claus. This movie has a slower roll than a lot of horror movies, with the 
tension slowly building rather than jumping right in. I won't spoil any part of it other than to say this movie is fantastic, as long 
as you're okay with full frontal male nudity. Seriously folks - if you don't want to see weiners don't watch this movie because it gets the 
R rating mostly because it is chock full of old man dangly bits. I mean - it is a european movie and I _swear_ the nudity makes sense.



## [A Christmas Horror Story](https://amzn.to/417WuIe)
### 7/10 ★
Multiple interwoven stories set on Christmas Eve, held together with William Shatner as a radio DJ on Christmas Eve on the one year anniversary of the murder 
of two teens in school basement we follow the story of three teenagers that go on a _sPoOkY_ trip to the scene where it happened. Meanwhile, a young boy 
starts acting strangely after a trip to get a Christmas tree, a family finds out the true meaning of Christmas from their Aunt and Jolly ole St. Nick fights 
an outbreak of zombie elves. What fun!

## [Krampus](https://amzn.to/3t21YYj)
### 6/10 ★
A dysfunctional family gets together for the holidays, but family tension causes their holiday spirit to wane. They find themselves trapped in the house 
with no power during a blizzard when bad things start happening. Did Uncle Howard (the crazy prepper) bring enough guns to shoot their way out? Let's 
be honest - this is a horror movie so probably not lol. Good solid fun, not quite the piece of exquisite art like Rare Exports, but definitely on the 
watch list every year.


# New for 2023


## [Silent Night](https://amzn.to/46A4rad)
### 7/10 ★
Apocalyptic black comedy starring Kiera Knightley about a group of old school friends getting together for a Christmas gathering. 
Seems like a tame setup except for one thing - an environmental collapse has caused a poison cloud to roam the country killing 
everyone in it's wake. To prevent people from dying horrible deaths the government has distributed poison suicide pills. 
The movie has some surprisingly funny parts in it, if you overlook the fact that the plot is way too real for comfort.
