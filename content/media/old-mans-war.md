Old Man's War was Scalzi's first novel so I thought it was fitting for it to be my first Scalzi novel read. The series takes place in a far off future 
where humans inhabit a galaxy inhabited by multiple races, most of which are fighting for resources. The Earth is being used as a resource by the 
Colonial Defense Force (CDF) as a source of soldiers through a rather novel recruiting
