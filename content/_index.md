# Well hello there! 
I'm Carl and this is my website, there are many like it, but this one is mine. I've had this domain for quite a while and it's gone through a few iterations. I've been kind of fascinated by  [static site generators]( {{< ref "posts/history.md" >}}#ssg) for a while but I had to work up the energy to actually look into them and figure out what I wanted to do. I finally settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is an open-source SSG that I've rather enjoyed working with. 

For the time being I'll probably be posting stuff about the process of building a site in Hugo, some stuff about living on a farm and maybe eventually I'll get to other nerdy math stuff like drawing fractals in JavaScript or some crap like that =)
