# Howdy! 
This is my website, there are many like it, but this one is mine. I've had a website of one kind or another for just about as long as 
websites were a thing. However, for a while there it was a pretty terrible static page with not much on it. I finally decided to build something 
right around the time the dude who had been [sitting on this domain gave up]({{<ref "posts/history.md" >}}#carltracy). 
I've been kind of fascinated by  [static site generators]( {{< ref "posts/history.md" >}}#ssg) for a while but I had to work up the energy to actually look into them,
figure out what I liked, how to host it, etc. I finally settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is an open-source SSG that I've rather enjoyed working with. 

For the time being I'll probably be posting stuff about the process of building a site in Hugo, some stuff about living on a farm and maybe eventually I'll get to other nerdy math stuff like drawing fractals in JavaScript or some crap like that =)
