# Howdy! 
This is my website, there are many like it, but this one is mine. I've had a website for quite a while, but for a long time it was 
a pretty terrible static page with not much on it after I got tired of dealing with content management systems. I finally decided to build something 
right around the time the dude who had been [sitting on this domain gave up]({{<ref "posts/history.md" >}}#carltracy) this domain came up this domain for quite a while and it's gone through a few iterations. I've been kind of fascinated by  [static site generators]( {{< ref "posts/history.md" >}}#ssg) for a while but I had to work up the energy to actually look into them and figure out what I wanted to do. I finally settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is an open-source SSG that I've rather enjoyed working with. 

For the time being I'll probably be posting stuff about the process of building a site in Hugo, some stuff about living on a farm and maybe eventually I'll get to other nerdy math stuff like drawing fractals in JavaScript or some crap like that =)
