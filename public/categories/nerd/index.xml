&lt;h2 id=&#34;advent-calendars&#34;&gt;Advent Calendars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a candy advent calendar for my wife and a whiskey advent calendar for me. I hope to write reviews
for both every day, but I&amp;rsquo;ll give the over under at April for when I actually write it lol =P&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hénon map</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-hénon-map-with-javascript&#34;&gt;Building a Hénon map with javascript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first found out about the Hénon map as an undergrad and have loved it ever since. Can I simulate it in javascript? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9non_map&#34;&gt;Hénon map&lt;/a&gt; is a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. It takes two
parameters a and b. Depending on the values the map can exhibit
 
 &lt;a href=&#34;javascript:setValues(0.5,0.2);&#34;&gt;periodic&lt;/a&gt; 
, &lt;a href=&#34;javascript:setValues(1.4,0.2);&#34;&gt;chaotic&lt;/a&gt;  or intermittent  (switching back and forth between
chaotic and stable orbits).  It is described by the formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}&lt;br&gt;
x_{n+1} &amp;amp;=  1 - ax_n^2+y_n\\
y_{n+1}  &amp;amp;= bx_n
\end{aligned}&lt;br&gt;
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hénon map is basically taking the x-y plane and stretches, folds and squishes it like kneading bread. For some parameters it will
tend toward a fixed point or set of points, but for others it exhibits chaotic dynamics - which means that no matter how accurately
you describe the current position, it will be impossible to predict where it will be in the future (other than within the bounds
of the attractor).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://carltracy.com/images/books.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Stack of Books&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 I started listening to audio books on Audible and I read a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of books. Inspired by my friend  &lt;a href=&#34;https://jenmyers.net&#34;&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; I started
a media log. Jen catalogs all her media and I am not nearly that ambitious and I actually wanted to start writing short reviews and that really
doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with my work load/ADHD. So for the most part my media log is more like a running list of very short summaries of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read.
I am certain that nobody really gives a shit but I&amp;rsquo;m not doing this for them anyway =)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out my media log &lt;a href=&#34;https://carltracy.com/media/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hosting from AWS with GitHub</title>

      <description>Back at it again Well I certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with this lately. Part of that is I just feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say and part of it is the setup I had was a little too much of a pain to deploy. Because, you know, actually having to log in and push 2 or 3 buttons is so much of a pain. Anyway, I got a bug up my butt and figured out how to build things with AWS and GitHub and did a small project over at Evil Peep which has been sitting dormant for around 12 years.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer First off let me say that I am by no means an authority on web technology, I wanted to re-do my website and part of that is making content. Writing is one of the things that I really suck at doing so I&amp;rsquo;m basically forcing myself to do it here, and part of that is discussing the technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years to build it.
How my websites were built The early days Back in the mid to late 90s, around the time I was graduating from college, the web started to become a thing.</description>

      <title>Tiktok Shortcode for Hugo</title>

      <description>Tiktok shortcode for Hugo When i was trying to post my adorable Tiktok of a wee baby duck that was just hatching, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything about embedding Tiktoks into Hugo. I tried just pasting the embed code into a markdown page, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work so I wrote a quick and dirty shortcode to do it:
tiktok.html: Save this code in \layouts\shortcodes\tiktok.html
&amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;tiktok-embed&amp;#34; cite=&amp;#34;https://www.tiktok.com/{{ .Get &amp;#34;usr&amp;#34; }}/video/{{ .</description>

      <title>Formula for the Weighted Average Life of a Mortgage</title>

      <description>A while ago for work I had created a process that required a formula for the weighted average life (WAL) of a mortgage with level payments. I found one online:
$$ W = N D_N - \frac{1}{r} $$
where:
$$ \begin{aligned}
d &amp;amp;= { 1 \over 1 + r} = \hbox{one month discount factor} \\[7pt] r &amp;amp;= {a \over 12} = \hbox{monthly discount} \\[10pt] N &amp;amp;= \hbox{Loan period in months} \\[10pt] D_n &amp;amp;= {1 \over 1-d^n} \end{aligned}</description>

      <title>Setting Up Hugo with SSL and MathJax</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun setting up Hugo to set it up how I want. I will caveat this with a few things - I tried to do things the right way (not editing the theme directly) but I&amp;rsquo;m really really really fucking impatient and in a lot of cases I just edited the theme because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with this shit. I&amp;rsquo;m never going to update it so screw it.</description>

      <description>While setting up this website I was constantly greeted by this in my address bar:
I have no real reason for it to piss me off but it surely did. This must be remedied.
My hosting is different from my registrar/DNS so accomplishing it took a little more work than it might if you have all that stuff in one place. I use namecheap as my registrar/DNS and HostPapa for my hosting (mostly because I used to use Lunarpages and they got bought by HostPapa).</description>

      <description>Well hey look it worked! That&amp;rsquo;s pretty rad. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to add to this, mostly this post is to make sure the script that I wrote to autobuild and commit to [GitHub](git commit -a &amp;ndash;allow-empty-message) works =)</description>
