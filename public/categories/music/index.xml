      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;OtR 2022 Xmas&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/OtR_2022_xmas.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My group at work recently got moved to a different department. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily view it is a bad thing, but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expected.&#xA;Being moved from Investments into Risk Management almost certainly makes sense given the type of work that we do, I get to keep my manager&#xA;who is amazing and his new boss is somebody I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before, but I knew socially when he worked on our floor and is a pretty&#xA;good guy. One of the nice things about the Risk group is they do a lot more social things, which I appreciate because while I&amp;rsquo;m not&#xA;&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; social gatherings, I generally won&amp;rsquo;t think to organize them on my own. So far the events seem to be well thought out and just the&#xA;right amount of fun while also being appropriate for the workplace. This year as part of one of our larger meetings there was a poll about our favorite&#xA;holiday activities, foods, songs, etc. The question about favorite holiday song made me laugh because my favorite holiday songs are almost certainly&#xA;not the same as most folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
