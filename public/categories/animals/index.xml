&lt;p&gt;This is #17. He&amp;rsquo;s named #17 because over the last several years we have caught, neutered and rehomed or released &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than 17 cats (sometimes we get kittens so we end up with 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we entertain the vet office very much). Thankfully our vet is absolutely amazing and gives us a deal when we fix strays. Because we live right off the freeway, are a bit out of Columbus, and because for some damn reason folks think barns are a great place to drop off cats without asking we end up with a lot of cats that get dropped off.  Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve begun to refer to ourselves as &amp;ldquo;Not a cat rescue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dear reader have ever considered dropping your cat off in the country because you couldn&amp;rsquo;t take care of them anymore, please consider a few things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
