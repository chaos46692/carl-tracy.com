      <description>Inspired by my friend Jen, here is the media I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a hard time reading books and recently started using Audible to listen to audio books.

I burned through tons of books and very much outpaced the one credit a month I got from Audible.</description>
