      <description>I hate people This is #17. He&amp;rsquo;s named #17 because over the last several years we have caught, neutered and rehomed or released more than 17 cats (sometimes we get kittens so we end up with 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we entertain the vet office very much). Thankfully our vet is absolutely amazing and gives us a deal when we fix strays. Because we live right off the freeway, are a bit out of Columbus, and because for some damn reason folks think barns are a great place to drop off cats without asking we end up with a lot of cats that get dropped off.</description>
