      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off let me say that I am by no means an authority on web technology, I wanted to re-do my website and part of that is making content. Writing is one of the things that I really suck at doing so I&amp;rsquo;m basically forcing myself to do it here, and part of that is discussing the technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years to build it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-my-websites-were-built&#34;&gt;How my websites were built&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-days&#34;&gt;The early days&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in the mid to late 90s, around the time I was graduating from college, the web started to become a thing. It was this neat new tool that would allow you build something that anyone in the world could see. The functionality was pretty limited and a good portion of the content was written in HTML (hypertext markup language), by hand, in text files and had to be set up manually on your system (usually in a directory like ~\public_html\). You had to set permissions and do all sorts of crazy stuff to make it work and even beyond that you had to have &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; to a computer system that allowed you to host websites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
