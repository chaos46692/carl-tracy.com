&lt;p&gt;My group at work recently got moved to a different department. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily view it is a bad thing, but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expected.
Being moved from Investments into Risk Management almost certainly makes sense given the type of work that we do, I get to keep my manager
who is amazing and his new boss is somebody I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before, but I knew socially when he worked on our floor and is a pretty
good guy. One of the nice things about the Risk group is they do a lot more social things, which I appreciate because while I&amp;rsquo;m not
&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; social gatherings, I generally won&amp;rsquo;t think to organize them on my own. So far the events seem to be well thought out and just the
right amount of fun while also being appropriate for the workplace. This year as part of one of our larger meetings there was a poll about our favorite
holiday activities, foods, songs, etc. The question about favorite holiday song made me laugh because my favorite holiday songs are almost certainly
not the same as most folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
