      <description>New beginnings My group at work recently got moved to a different department. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily view it is a bad thing, but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expected. Being moved from Investments into Risk Management almost certainly makes sense given the type of work that we do, I get to keep my manager who is amazing and his new boss is somebody I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before, but I knew socially when he worked on our floor and is a pretty good guy.</description>
