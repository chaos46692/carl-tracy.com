      <description>In 2022 I started listening to audio books on Audible and I read a lot of books. Inspired by my friend Jen I started a media log. Jen catalogs all her media and I am not nearly that ambitious and I actually wanted to start writing short reviews and that really doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with my work load/ADHD. So for the most part my media log is more like a running list of very short summaries of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description>

      <description>Inspired by my friend Jen, here is the media I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a hard time reading books and recently started using Audible to listen to audio books. I had put it off for a long time, figuring that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use it and I would just waste money. Oh boy was I wrong. I burned through tons of books and very much outpaced the one credit a month I got from Audible.</description>
