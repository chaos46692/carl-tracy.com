      <description>The Bobiverse follows the exploits of Bob, a computer engineer who lives the dream by becoming fantastically wealthy only to die shortly after and awake after his consciousness has been uploaded into a computer which is going to be use to control a von Neumann probe (a self-replicating spacecraft). The series follows Bob as he expands through the universe, saves humanity and a few other species from existential threats, and ponders the meaning of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Problem Series by Cixin Liu</title>

      <description>One of my work friends had recommended The Three-Body Problem to me and it sounded interesting â€” it starts with the Chinese cultural revolution and goes through the heat death of the universe. You know, usual stuff there. The original is written in Chinese and while I found that the story was great sometimes the prose was a little lacking. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s due to the translation, language and cultural differences in writing between English and Chinese, or if the Cixin Liu&amp;rsquo;s style just isn&amp;rsquo;t quite what I was used to coming off of reading a lot of Scalzi</description>

 Thinking in Systems Donella H. Meadows Why We&amp;rsquo;re Polarized Ezra Klein You&amp;rsquo;re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) Felicia Day The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) Katie Mack Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War Series _John Scalzi_
Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War was John Scalzi&amp;rsquo;s debut novel and it is fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I knew Scalzi from Twitter long before I read any of his novels. He seems to be a decent person who loves burritos1 and he writes some pretty great novels.</description>
