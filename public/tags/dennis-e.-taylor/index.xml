      <description>The Bobiverse follows the exploits of Bob, a computer engineer who lives the dream by becoming fantastically wealthy only to die shortly after and awake after his consciousness has been uploaded into a computer which is going to be use to control a von Neumann probe (a self-replicating spacecraft). The series follows Bob as he expands through the universe, saves humanity and a few other species from existential threats, and ponders the meaning of the universe.</description>
