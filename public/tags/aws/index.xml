      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;back-at-it-again&#34;&gt;Back at it again&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with this lately. Part of that is I just feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say and part of it is the setup I had was a little too much of a pain to deploy.&#xA;Because, you know, actually having to log in and push 2 or 3 buttons is &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; much of a pain. Anyway, I got a bug up my butt and figured out how to build things with AWS and GitHub and did&#xA;a small project over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evilpeep.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Evil Peep&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  which has been sitting dormant for around 12 years. I figured while I was at it I might was well implement it for my site&#xA;and use the opportunity to move from my old domain to this one! While I&amp;rsquo;m at it I figured I&amp;rsquo;d document what I did to make it all work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
