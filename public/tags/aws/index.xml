      <description>Back at it again Well I certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with this lately. Part of that is I just feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say and part of it is the setup I had was a little too much of a pain to deploy. Because, you know, actually having to log in and push 2 or 3 buttons is so much of a pain. Anyway, I got a bug up my butt and figured out how to build things with AWS and GitHub and did a small project over at Evil Peep which has been sitting dormant for around 12 years.</description>
