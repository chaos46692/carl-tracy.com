      <description>Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War was Scalzi&amp;rsquo;s first novel so I thought it was fitting for it to be my first Scalzi novel read. The series takes place in a far off future where humans inhabit a galaxy inhabited by multiple races, most of which are fighting for resources. The Earth is being used as a resource by the Colonial Defense Force (CDF) as a source of soldiers through a rather novel recruiting</description>

      <description>The Bobiverse follows the exploits of Bob, a computer engineer who lives the dream by becoming fantastically wealthy only to die shortly after and awake after his consciousness has been uploaded into a computer which is going to be use to control a von Neumann probe (a self-replicating spacecraft). The series follows Bob as he expands through the universe, saves humanity and a few other species from existential threats, and ponders the meaning of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Problem Series by Cixin Liu</title>
      <link>https://carltracy.com/media/three-body-problem/</link>

      <description>One of my work friends had recommended The Three-Body Problem to me and it sounded interesting â€” it starts with the Chinese cultural revolution and goes through the heat death of the universe. You know, usual stuff there. The original is written in Chinese and while I found that the story was great sometimes the prose was a little lacking. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s due to the translation, language and cultural differences in writing between English and Chinese, or if the Cixin Liu&amp;rsquo;s style just isn&amp;rsquo;t quite what I was used to coming off of reading a lot of Scalzi</description>

Thinking in Systems Donella H. Meadows Why We&amp;rsquo;re Polarized Ezra Klein You&amp;rsquo;re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) Felicia Day The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) Katie Mack Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War Series _John Scalzi_
Old Man&amp;rsquo;s War was John Scalzi&amp;rsquo;s debut novel and it is fantastic. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I knew Scalzi from Twitter long before I read any of his novels. He seems to be a decent person who loves burritos1 and he writes some pretty great novels.</description>

      <title>Reality Christmas with Over the Rhine</title>

&lt;p&gt;My group at work recently got moved to a different department. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily view it is a bad thing, but it certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t expected. 
Being moved from Investments into Risk Management almost certainly makes sense given the type of work that we do, I get to keep my manager 
who is amazing and his new boss is somebody I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked with before, but I knew socially when he worked on our floor and is a pretty 
good guy. One of the nice things about the Risk group is they do a lot more social things, which I appreciate because while I&amp;rsquo;m not 
&lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; social gatherings, I generally won&amp;rsquo;t think to organize them on my own. So far the events seem to be well thought out and just the 
right amount of fun while also being appropriate for the workplace. This year as part of one of our larger meetings there was a poll about our favorite 
holiday activities, foods, songs, etc. The question about favorite holiday song made me laugh because my favorite holiday songs are almost certainly 
not the same as most folks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We are not a cat rescue</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is #17. He&amp;rsquo;s named #17 because over the last several years we have caught, neutered and rehomed or released &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than 17 cats (sometimes we get kittens so we end up with 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we entertain the vet office very much). Thankfully our vet is absolutely amazing and gives us a deal when we fix strays. Because we live right off the freeway, are a bit out of Columbus, and because for some damn reason folks think barns are a great place to drop off cats without asking we end up with a lot of cats that get dropped off.  Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve begun to refer to ourselves as &amp;ldquo;Not a cat rescue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dear reader have ever considered dropping your cat off in the country because you couldn&amp;rsquo;t take care of them anymore, please consider a few things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hosting from AWS with GitHub</title>

      <description>Back at it again Well I certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with this lately. Part of that is I just feel like I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say and part of it is the setup I had was a little too much of a pain to deploy. Because, you know, actually having to log in and push 2 or 3 buttons is so much of a pain. Anyway, I got a bug up my butt and figured out how to build things with AWS and GitHub and did a small project over at Evil Peep which has been sitting dormant for around 12 years.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer First off let me say that I am by no means an authority on web technology, I wanted to re-do my website and part of that is making content. Writing is one of the things that I really suck at doing so I&amp;rsquo;m basically forcing myself to do it here, and part of that is discussing the technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve used over the years to build it.
How my websites were built The early days Back in the mid to late 90s, around the time I was graduating from college, the web started to become a thing.</description>

      <description>Tiktok shortcode for Hugo When i was trying to post my adorable Tiktok of a wee baby duck that was just hatching, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything about embedding Tiktoks into Hugo. I tried just pasting the embed code into a markdown page, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work so I wrote a quick and dirty shortcode to do it:
tiktok.html: Save this code in \layouts\shortcodes\tiktok.html
&amp;lt;script async src=&amp;#34;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote class=&amp;#34;tiktok-embed&amp;#34; cite=&amp;#34;https://www.tiktok.com/{{ .Get &amp;#34;usr&amp;#34; }}/video/{{ .</description>

      <title>Formula for the Weighted Average Life of a Mortgage</title>

      <description>A while ago for work I had created a process that required a formula for the weighted average life (WAL) of a mortgage with level payments. I found one online:
$$ W = N D_N - \frac{1}{r} $$
where:
$$ \begin{aligned}
d &amp;amp;= { 1 \over 1 + r} = \hbox{one month discount factor} \\[7pt] r &amp;amp;= {a \over 12} = \hbox{monthly discount} \\[10pt] N &amp;amp;= \hbox{Loan period in months} \\[10pt] D_n &amp;amp;= {1 \over 1-d^n} \end{aligned}</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun setting up Hugo to set it up how I want. I will caveat this with a few things - I tried to do things the right way (not editing the theme directly) but I&amp;rsquo;m really really really fucking impatient and in a lot of cases I just edited the theme because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with this shit. I&amp;rsquo;m never going to update it so screw it.</description>

I have no real reason for it to piss me off but it surely did. This must be remedied.
My hosting is different from my registrar/DNS so accomplishing it took a little more work than it might if you have all that stuff in one place. I use namecheap as my registrar/DNS and HostPapa for my hosting (mostly because I used to use Lunarpages and they got bought by HostPapa).</description>

      <description>Well hey look it worked! That&amp;rsquo;s pretty rad. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to add to this, mostly this post is to make sure the script that I wrote to autobuild and commit to [GitHub](git commit -a &amp;ndash;allow-empty-message) works =)</description>

      <description>Hello World! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I did anything with this site. I finally got around to building something with Hugo. I kind of dig the idea of a static site generator but I generally run Windows machines so it was kind of a pain in the ass. I finally got around to installing Linux Mint on a virtual machine so now it was much easier to check out.</description>
