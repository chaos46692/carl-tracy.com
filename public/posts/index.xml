      <description>A while ago for work I had created a process that required a formula for the weighted average life (WAL) of a mortgage with level payments. I found one online:
$$ W = N D_N - \frac{1}{r} $$
where:
$$ \begin{aligned}
d &amp;amp;= { 1 \over 1 + r} = \hbox{one month discount factor} \\[7pt] r &amp;amp;= {a \over 12} = \hbox{monthly discount} \\[10pt] N &amp;amp;= \hbox{Loan period in months} \\[10pt] D_n &amp;amp;= {1 \over 1-d^n} \end{aligned}</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of fun setting up Hugo to set it up how I want. I will caveat this with a few things - I tried to do things the right way (not editing the theme directly) but I&amp;rsquo;m really really really fucking impatient and in a lot of cases I just edited the theme because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with this shit. I&amp;rsquo;m never going to update it so screw it.</description>

      <description>While setting up this website I was constantly greeted by this in my address bar:
I have no real reason for it to piss me off but it surely did. This must be remedied.
My hosting is different from my registrar/DNS so accomplishing it took a little more work than it might if you have all that stuff in one place. I use namecheap as my registrar/DNS and HostPapa for my hosting (mostly because I used to use Lunarpages and they got bought by HostPapa).</description>

      <description>Well hey look it worked! That&amp;rsquo;s pretty rad. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to add to this, mostly this post is to make sure the script that I wrote to autobuild and commit to [GitHub](git commit -a &amp;ndash;allow-empty-message) works =)</description>

      <description>Hello World! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I did anything with this site. I finally got around to building something with Hugo. I kind of dig the idea of a static site generator but I generally run Windows machines so it was kind of a pain in the ass. I finally got around to installing Linux Mint on a virtual machine so now it was much easier to check out.</description>
